<h2 class="nobreak">PROLOGUE<br><br>
OLD LIGHTS OF THE RIO BRAVA</h2><br>
<h3>I</h3></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Bob Leadley</span> moved toward the sound of guitars.
The strumming came from over the stream
where the Mexicans had their own little cantina
and their dobe huts. Back from the ‘Damask
Cheek,’ which was the palpitating core of the
white settlement, voices of the miners reached
him, not loud to-night, not uproarious. Things
were seldom duller than now on the Rio Brava,
shrunken to a trickle at this time of year. The
eke of gold had been at its lowest for days on the
placers. A hot, still August night in Bismo, Arizona—the
night that changed one white man
all around.</p>

<p>Mexican figures bowed to him. A woman laughingly
called from a darkened doorway: ‘Buenas
noches, señor!’ Another laughed from behind
her, adding somewhat wistfully: ‘Hace un calor
sofocante.’</p>

<p>He walked on past the dobe huts and on to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
mesa. He heard the coyotes—different from
any time before. There was no moon and the
stars were indistinct, run together in the heat
haze. Bob Leadley took off his hat; drops of
sweat held by the tight hatband, dropped down
on his face. He had to laugh at himself—the
feelings that rolled and tumbled over each other
within. Nobody would have believed it of him—feelings
to keep a secret of. It was as if some one
he had always been waiting for, had come to town—not
yet seen, a friend or enemy, he couldn’t
tell, but a life-or-death meaning to the arrival.
Running steps reached him from behind; a panting
voice calling:</p>

<p>‘Bob! Bob!’</p>

<p>‘Hello, Mort,’ he answered as the other came
up, the tone so quiet and cool, it was almost
whimsical.</p>

<p>‘What you doing away off here?’</p>

<p>‘She didn’t want me there.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a boy, Bob, only—’</p>

<p>‘I thought as much.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a boy all right, only she—they say she
ain’t going to live.’</p>

<p>The mother was already dead, but this was
Mort Cotton’s way of softening the shock for a
friend.</p>

<p>The same easy tone answered: ‘Guess we’d
better walk back.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>‘I wouldn’t hurry, if I was you. Bob. I’ll run
back if you like and get the rest of the word.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was her doings that they called the child
Bart, after some saint of her religion. She had a
lot of saints, one for every day or so—a Spanish
woman, and she hadn’t asked much, come to
think of it.</p>

<p>The oddest thing Bob Leadley had ever done
was to marry her. He never would have thought
better of it, except it made a difference in the
town. It would make more of a difference now—leaving
a boy with her blood in his veins. They
wouldn’t call it ‘Spanish’ blood in Bismo. Mexicans
weren’t held high on this side of the Border....
Queer little birdlike ways, she had—little
vanities and secrets—always shrinking farther
indoors in daylight, always more alive in the
night time. She had sung and cooked and washed
for him; pleasant to be with, but he never really
knew her. She was like ripe fruit that couldn’t
last—pleasant to the taste and pretty to look at,
but nothing much for real hunger. Come and
gone with her curious ways, her brightenings up
in the dark—only asking one thing—that the
boy be called after this particular one of her
saints, and ‘Bart’ was as good a name as any.</p>

<p>So there was a gray-eyed white man in Bismo,
Arizona, with a black-eyed boy in his cabin. No
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>problem about it at all, from the standpoint of
the other miners, just scorn—only Bob Leadley
had been known from away back as cool and
gamy as they made them; nothing like the squaw-man,
cholo-man type. The miners couldn’t give
much play to their contempt before those pleasant
gray eyes of Bob’s, which might inquire their
meaning, and look into it. Men weren’t mind-readers
in Bismo. They saw the steady eyes, the
whimsical smile, but no one knew what was going
on; not even Mort Cotton, who had punched cattle,
skinned mules, and washed for gold with Bob
Leadley for ten years; not even the Mexican
woman and her daughter who brought Bart up.
But it was all a matter of how you gave advice.
Bismo found out gradually that Bob wasn’t set
up very high in his idea of being a successful
parent. They found he listened attentively to
comment given within a certain range of tones;
discovering this, the miners supplied it plentifully.</p>

<p>The social barrier in Bismo was the river itself.
Mexican laborers worked, two to one to the white
men, in the placers, but the two settlements rarely
mixed outside working hours, except when waves
of drink inundated the white miners. Then they
would move over to Dobe-town to drink and ‘eat
different,’ the calls ending in a row, not infrequently
in the death of a ‘greaser.’ Letchie
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>Welton, the town marshal, wasn’t even to be
approached on a matter like this, and sounds of
mourning from one or more dobe huts seldom
reached as far as the ‘Damask Cheek,’ any more
than the strumming of guitars....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Several times in the next dozen years, Bob
Leadley and Mort Cotton were on the point of
leaving Bismo, but the Rio Brava had a way of
suddenly picking up, the gold eke rising to quite
a little color. There was another thing; it was
hard for Bob to make up his mind to take Bart
away from the Mexican woman and her daughter.
It didn’t seem fair. The old señora had been
a friend of Bart’s mother and loved the white
man’s boy; also her daughter loved him. But
Bart was growing up more Mexican than white;
talked Spanish in preference to English; was more
often seen across the stream than on this side,
and running with the Mexican boys, one Palto
especially, than with the four or five white boys
of his age in town. Bart’s whole business was
horses, but Mexican words having to do with
them were too easy on his tongue—hondos, latigos,
reatas, conchos, yakimas. A slim, black-haired
youth, slow to rouse, not cruel or a fool;
an easy way with him; not stirred in the least by
the thought of washing gold; no idea of working
hours, as being superior to all others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>Just to see Bart leaning against the doorway—on
his feet, but relaxed in a way no white boy
could stand, a guitar in his hand, perhaps—had
a way of filling his father with a revulsion that
Bob had to take out to the mesa to quiet. It was
as if the man saw the face of his boy under a high-tinted
sombrero (instead of the cast-off cavalryman’s
campaign hat with a Copley peak) as if a
sash of seda were thrust back over the shoulder.
Bob didn’t quite know it, but it was because he
was seeing Bart with the eyes of the other miners
at these times—that he was stung so. The town
had put a secret fear on him that his boy was not
showing up white.</p>

<p>The father lacked one thing that parents usually
have to work with. He didn’t have the sense
of being right at all times. Once or twice he felt
so sure of himself that he treated Bart to a whipping,
which the boy took without a murmur,
minding pain no more than an Indian. He never
explained. The father got one of the starts of his
life to find he had whipped Bart for a thing he
didn’t do, the boy not taking the trouble to clear
himself. Bob’s feeble sense of rightness was
shaken by that; it about all went out of him, and
something else with it. The deep hurt of it was
that Bart held no grievance afterward.</p>

<p>A master at letting other men alone, Bob
couldn’t keep his thoughts and his will-power off
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>the boy. He made up for his rare rough periods
by being lenient. All the time his actions and
reactions brought advice from his fellow townsmen.
It was Letchie Welton, the town marshal,
who started the saying that Bart wouldn’t live
to be hanged. All this time Bob Leadley’s eyes
were the most light-hearted anywhere.</p>

<p>‘As a male-parent, I’m considerable of a botch—I
admit that,’ he would say, in a way to delude
anybody that he ever suffered real care, and at
the same time there was a sorrow burning at the
center of him like a red lamp. Often at work on
the placer, he knew a loneliness to get close to his
boy. He might have seen Bart at breakfast, but
that made no difference. He felt lonely for him
more than once, when they were in the same room
together.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Bart</span> was past twelve, when he was missing for a
day or two, and rode back into town on a gray
rat-tailed pony that was raked from shoulder to
crupper with fresh wounds and old scars. Letchie
Welton, in the capacity of deputy sheriff, halted
him at the edge of town, looking the outfit over.</p>

<p>‘Where did you get that briscut?’</p>

<p>‘Over at the Cup Q.’</p>

<p>‘Did you do all that fresh hookin’ on his hide?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘Buy him?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>‘No, they didn’t want him much over at the
rancho. Said I could have him for sitting thirty
seconds—’</p>

<p>‘And you did?’</p>

<p>‘Yep—more. I ain’t got off.’</p>

<p>Letchie Welton looked queer and rode back to
the placers where he found Bob Leadley. ‘Your
kid’s just brought in a man-killer from the Cup
Q—a gray rat-tail I remember seein’ over there.
If I was you, Bob, I’d put a bullet in the head of
that cayuse, and I’d leave off work and do it now—before
he kicks a hole out of Bart’s face or eats
his scalp off.’ Letchie Welton went on to recall
further details of Rat-tail’s reputation—of the
fits he threw, the men he had maimed.</p>

<p>Bob left the placer and went to his own little
corral where he found Rat-tail unsaddled, Bart
leaning in the fence shadow, looking over his new
possession.</p>

<p>‘I hear he’s an outlaw, Bart. I wouldn’t ride
him if I was you.’</p>

<p>‘I rode him over from the Cup Q all right.’</p>

<p>‘I know. He may have been glad to get away
from there—but look at him!’ Bob took a few
steps closer to the old gray head which suddenly
looked deformed. A float of baleful red appeared
back of the near, filmy eye.</p>

<p>‘I’ve seen that look once or twice before, Bart,
and I’ll have to tell you to stay off him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>‘All he knew from the Cup Q was rakin’ and
quirtin’, Dad.’</p>

<p>‘But that ain’t the look of a nice hoss.’</p>

<p>‘I like him.’</p>

<p>‘It ain’t the look of a broke hoss, Bart.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t want no broke hoss.’</p>

<p>‘You’ll have to stay off, that’s all—’</p>

<p>Bob saw that deep questioning look in the eyes
slowly turned his way—no anger, no hate, but
separateness, a widening gulf.</p>

<p>‘At least, stay off him till I try him out for a
few days.’</p>

<p>Bob was sincere in his attempt to make the rat-tail
safe for his son, but the toughest saddle-sessions
he had ever known, followed in the next
ten days. Where the ordinary outlaw left off with
sun-fish and rail-fence, the old gray opened fresh
spontaneities. One of the last things he did with
Bob forked, was to make a quarter-mile sprint
toward a low-hanging cottonwood limb, the idea
being to rake off his tormentor, which he carried
out. Another time when Bob persisted several
seconds longer than usual, the rat-tail came out
of a buckling snap—to fling himself on the
ground. The day came when Bob Leadley, cool-eyed,
a smile on his lips, would have preferred to
stand up and be shot at, than mount the gray
monster again, but that’s what he did, it being
his code. That day Rat-tail plunged into a dobe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>wall and left Bart’s father on the inside of a
crowded chicken yard with a broken leg.</p>

<p>‘I should have done what Letchie told me,
Bart,’ Bob said that night. ‘He ain’t a man-killer
just; he’s a man-eater. You’ll have to leave
him alone from now on.’</p>

<p>‘You tried hookin’ him, the way they did over
in the Cup Q. It makes him crazy. He ain’t crazy
natural, his mouth’s tender. He’s been driven
crazy. He needs humorin’, Dad.’</p>

<p>Anger flamed up in the father. He had been a
horse-hand all his life. ‘I say keep off him, from
now on.’</p>

<p>Three days later Mort Cotton came into the
cabin, his bushy eyebrows showing curiously
white. ‘I hate to tell on the kid, Bob, but it’ll
get to you anyway,’ he said. ‘He’s been riding
that rat-tail on a hackamore—he’s ridin’ him
now. And what I’m gettin’ at is, he ain’t havin’
trouble.’</p>

<p>Bob’s face turned to the wall. He had many
days to think it out while his leg was in boards....
It was disobedience, but had he been right?
Didn’t Bart have something on the gray others
hadn’t—with other horses, too, perhaps? It
wasn’t a matter of just sitting a horse. Bob knew
without vanity he could do that as well as most
men. It was something new; not to be expressed.
He had seen the deformed look of the gray’s head
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>straighten out as Bart drew near; the red flame
of the eye die down. Bart had something on him—a
new feel with a horse.</p>

<p>‘I belong to the old school,’ he muttered. ‘All
we know is that a hoss has to be broke; that a
hoss is ruined that once gets his own way. Bart
ain’t a part of that. He makes a hoss forget his
own way. He gives him his courage back.  But
it’s disobedience—I dasn’t let Bart get away
with it. They’d think I was crazy—if I didn’t
get rid of the rat-tail.’</p>

<p>Mort Cotton took the old outlaw back to the
Cup Q as a led-horse.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Finally</span> the morning, a year or two later, when
old Batten, the storekeeper at Bismo, was found
murdered by Bob Leadley’s serving woman who
had gone over for a can of condensed milk. Her
outcry roused the town. The old man had been
hammered over the head and pulled out from his
own back room, or else he had reached that far
before they finished him. Things were spilled.
There were sticky tracks on the floor and a winy
smell in the gray of morning. A cask of apricot
brandy in the place, no one knew how old, was
still dripping when Bob Leadley got there. He
recalled that Batten had never sold any of this
brandy, holding it choice and sending a little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>flask to any one who was sick. What struck him
queerly, too, was old Batten’s thin white hair,
not combed back as usual.</p>

<p>Letchie Welton came in and propped the old
man up against the counter for a better look.
The marshal’s jaw got harder and whiter as he
repeated that it was a Mexican job. The town
was crowding in. Bob Leadley noted that his
boy, Bart, was standing around. ‘Go on back
home and get your breakfast, Bart,’ he said.</p>

<p>The whole white settlement was inside or at
the store doors by this time. Mort Cotton’s voice
seemed to find the strangest hush for this sentence:
‘They needn’t have killed him. Old Batten
would have given them all that they took—at
least trusted ’em for what they took—’</p>

<p>It sounded so innocent and mournful, but it
was like blowing on fire—the effect on the
crowd. Every one was thinking something of the
same kind, and a sort of hell took hold and united
them—the same contagion that makes a mob.
The cask had ceased to drip—not yet five in the
morning. No one knew how much money Batten
had in the place.</p>

<p>‘A Mexican job,’ repeated Letchie Welton, his
jaw getting harder and whiter. ‘We’ll just go over
to Dobe-town right now and see who’s missing.’</p>

<p>They routed out the shacks across the river.
Two Mexicans, Marguerin and Rueda, couldn’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>be accounted for; also a boy, called Palto around
the diggings, was gone. About this time Bob
Leadley noticed that Bart hadn’t done what he was
told, but had come over the stream with the rest.</p>

<p>‘I told you to get out of here. Go home and
wait till I come.’</p>

<p>Now Bob recollected that Bart and Palto had
been thick at times.</p>

<p>No work on the mines that day. The ‘Damask
Cheek’ filled early. Ten men chosen by Letchie
Welton took the trail after the three Mexicans—a
trail that showed clear—three ponies headed
toward the Border, six or seven hours’ start.</p>

<p>All were thinking, as they rode, of that old
white head; ten men and the marshal, still keyed
to that sentence which Mort Cotton had spoken.
The thoughts of the posse working together this
way made the purpose deadly. Each man grew
painfully fond of old Batten, and the other side
of the fondness was rising hate for the Mexicans
ahead. Every little while some one said: ‘Poor
old Batten, he wouldn’t have hurt a toad.’</p>

<p>They were several miles out, before Bob Leadley
noticed that Bart was overtaking them from
behind. At first he thought Bart was bringing a
message from the town, but it proved he merely
wanted to go.</p>

<p>‘You turn around and ride back, just as fast
as you can, young man!’ the father said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Those were the words which fixed it the other
way.</p>

<p>‘Let him stick. Good chance to see what he’s
made of,’ Letchie Welton laughed, just as he
would have said: ‘Send him home,’ if Bob had
asked to let him stay.... The next day the posse
was pressing the three Mexicans a lot closer.
They didn’t seem more than three hours ahead.
It was desert work now, hot and grim. Toward
nightfall, they came to a fork where the fugitives
had broken apart, two turning to the left, one to
the right. Letchie Welton sent four men after the
lone pony to the right, and kept on with seven
after the other two. On the third noon the two
Mexicans, hard pressed, made their final split.
This broke up the pursuing party a second time;
Letchie Welton, Mort Cotton, Bob Leadley and
Bart keeping on straight south, the other four
turning east.</p>

<p>Toward sundown that third night, over a hundred
miles from Bismo, only Bart was riding light
and easy; his pony with a reserve left, the other
three horses done for, and their riders as well.
Canteens were empty; desert country, here and
there a big solitary cactus, rising like a shade tree
gone crazy.</p>

<p>‘There’s water ahead,’ Bart told his father.
‘I can tell by my pony’s ears.’</p>

<p>The lower rim of the sun was out of sight when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>they came to the Mexican’s horse, finished, lying
at the edge of a pool of stagnant, coated water,
choked in the hollows of a dry stream bed. The
man-tracks stretched on toward a shadowy mass
that proved to be the old hard-rock diggings of
Red Ante, long since abandoned by any miners,
Mexican or white. Letchie yanked up his horse’s
head from the pool.</p>

<p>‘Our game’s ahead, men. Come on, we’ll get
him and then come back to this pea-soup!’</p>

<p>Now, entering that deserted town, it was as if
Bob Leadley had to see every detail. Not that he
wanted to—but there seemed to be a pair of
extra clear eyes, working back of his regular eyes,
though he was partly out of his head from exhaustion.
The abandoned street, between the huts of
Red Ante, impressed him as something perpetual—moment
and place. At the same time, a kind
of insane anger was in his brain, because he had
to hold up the weight of his horse’s head on the
bridle-rein. The beast with dying strength, was
fighting to get back to that scummy pool; and
Bob, a heap in the saddle, was needing all his
strength to keep from falling. At the same time,
those deadly clear eyes of his took in the bone-white
curve of Letchie Welton’s jaw, the big rent
in Mort Cotton’s shirt under the left arm toward
the back, the skin showing wet and blistered
there—and all the rest in that falling dark: Huts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>partly sunken in blowing sand—wide-open door
of a deserted blacksmith shop—familiar as a
lithograph that had hung in his room for years—wide-open
door, rusty anvil, sledge standing by—big
rusty bear-trap in the center of the dirt
floor, with its half-inch chain running to the base
of the anvil—everything sagging and dust-covered.
Now Bob was letting himself down out
of the saddle—when Letchie’s pistol cracked,
and his voice yelled:</p>

<p>‘There he goes. I winged him. I got the son
of—’ A second pistol shot, as Letchie dug his
spurs into his horse and pressed on the dark
street. Bob Leadley and Mort Cotton staggered
after him on foot, Bart keeping with them on his
pony—to the last hut.</p>

<p>‘It’s Palto,’ they heard the boy say.</p>

<p>The young Mexican was on the ground. The
point dawning in Bob Leadley’s brain was that
it would have been so much better, simpler, if
one or both of Letchie’s shots had finished the
job. Palto was down to pray—kneeling on the
sand-blown, half-obliterated road. Welton jerked
his horse so close, it looked as if he meant to
trample the boy, before he stepped down. With
his boot he shoved the figure over on its side.</p>

<p>‘So it was you who did the hammering on old
man Batten’s skull—’</p>

<p>‘Yo, no, señor!’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>
<p>Not a man looking up, but the ashes of a boy—fag
and fright all that was left.</p>

<p>‘Weren’t even there, were you? Home in bed
all night. Just started out for a morning ride with
Marguerin and Rueda—’</p>

<p>‘Si, señor—was there, but no kill—’</p>

<p>Letchie turned his thin smile to the others. ‘I
guess you’ve heard that. I guess we’ve got what
we came for. I guess we’ve heard from his own
lips, he was one of the three.’</p>

<p>Bob Leadley wasn’t right in his own head; he
knew just enough to know that one thing. He
saw his son looking down at Palto. He saw—a
kind of humor about it—that Bart hadn’t mixed
in the pursuit with any sacred idea of the law’s
vengeance. Now the upshot of the whole matter
from Letchie Welton:</p>

<p>‘... accordin’ to law, we can’t finish him here
and be done with it. Bein’ still alive, we’ve got
to fix to take him back to where a court is. Only
if he should try to escape—we could put a bullet
through him; but he won’t do that, will you,
Palto?’</p>

<p>‘No, Señor!’ sliding away from Welton’s
boot.</p>

<p>‘We aren’t the court and can’t hang him here,
and there’s no shack in this hole of a town that
will hold him. Our horses are done for—they
won’t get back to Bismo—’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>Letchie’s words died out of Bob Leadley’s ears.

He was trying to find himself. He was seeing old
Batten’s white hair, not combed as usual; he was
seeing his own boy—a look in Bart’s face, different
from ever before. The hard white curve of
Letchie’s jaw was before his eyes and words
again:</p>

<p>‘I, for one, ain’t sittin’ up on guard to-night.
I’m not askin’ you fellows to do what I won’t do
myself.’</p>

<p>Something was crowding for utterance to Bob
Leadley’s lips, but Welton’s voice kept it from
coming clear. They might be here in Red Ante
for days, while some one rode back to Bismo for
fresh provisions and horses.</p>

<p>‘... He ain’t worth it—no greaser is. Only
one way—to fix him so he can’t get away—’</p>

<p>Now Bart spoke up: ‘I’ll stand guard over him
to-night. I don’t feel so done out—’</p>

<p>The father was glad in a crippled sort of fashion,
glad but afraid.</p>

<p>‘I guess not,’ said Letchie. ‘Wouldn’t look so
pretty when we got back, to have you tell ’em
you sat rifle-up over the prisoner while we got
our beauty sleep back.... No, I’m figurin’ out a
different way from what I saw up yonder—just
as we broke into town.’</p>

<p>He meant the blacksmith shop. Bob Leadley
saw Mort Cotton standing in the dark like a dirt-stained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
corpse. It might have been Batten himself.</p>

<p>‘I won’t take part in it,’ Bob thought. ‘I ain’t
marshal to say what’s what, but I won’t take no
part.’</p>

<p>Bart was looking his way, but Bob didn’t turn
to meet his son’s eyes. ‘I ain’t a man of law,’ he
was thinking. At the same time he felt Bart’s
eyes turning to him persistently, but he couldn’t
look. ‘I ain’t a man of law.’</p>

<p>The marshal was managing it alone....</p>

<p>Bob had been famished riding into town, but
the stuff left in his saddle-bags tasted like worms
to his tongue, and the water, as if running out of
a sore. Though he was half dead for it, there was
no sleep—with that racket from the blacksmith
shop down the dirt road of Red Ante. He didn’t
meet Bart’s eyes again. It was as if he had said
good-bye to his son for life.</p>

<p>Bob had dragged his blankets away from the
empty huts, far out on the sand to get beyond the
cries, but they were already in his soul—no getting
away. Long afterward, lying out there, he
heard the sound of a single shot from the direction
of the blacksmith shop—the end of all cries.
Welton was there before him, Mort Cotton appearing
from the side. Palto’s troubles were over—Bart
missing. It was not until daybreak that
the father found a note pinned to his saddle—written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
by Bart before the shot had been
fired.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I guess I don’t belong here, Dad. I’ll take Palto
with me, if I can get him loose. Otherwise—well,
you’ll know. So long for good, <span class="smcap">Bart</span>.</p>

<h2 id="I">I<br><br>
THIRTY YEARS LATE</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Arriving</span> when the present century was well
started, Elbert Sartwell had now concluded that
his was a most untimely birth. For instance, all
that war amounted to in his case, was the matter
of wearing puttees to school. The magic of his
youth was moreover smothered in a houseful of
sisters—imprisoned in a sorority-house, he found
himself—all his aching and persistent dreams
unexpressed.</p>

<p>But the end had come. Elbert had reached
decision; so had his father on the same point.
They were at odds. It was a matter of grief to the
son that for once there could be no compromise.</p>

<p>Fall darkness had closed about him, as these
things appeared before Elbert’s mind with finality.
He left his room, followed the long wide hall
to the door of his father’s dressing-room and
knocked. It was the last quarter of an hour before
dinner, and the tone of the ‘Come in’ was not
encouraging, but it didn’t occur to Elbert to wait
until dinner and tobacco had combed down his
father’s tag-ends of the day.</p>

<p>Mr. Sartwell was standing before his mirrors
and did not turn, as the hall door opened. Elbert
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>nodded at the reflection; also he observed in the
glass a look of fresh vexation, which reminded
him that his sister Nancy this very afternoon had
smashed the fender and left front wheel of the
new phaëton. His father had probably just heard
about it. The present moment couldn’t be worse,
but Elbert didn’t see how he could back out now
with his ultimatum unreported.</p>

<p>‘I’ve been thinking it over,’ he said, ‘and I
can’t start to work in the office, at least not now.
You see, I’ve always wanted—’</p>

<p>‘“Always wanted”—’ broke in Mr. Sartwell,
‘“always wanted” against my better judgment....
A houseful of “always wanteds”! How can
a man be expected to stand in the midst of six
people, always wanting in different directions?’</p>

<p>‘I hate to be an added trouble to you,’ Elbert
said in his unruffled way, ‘but there’s no use of
my trying to go into the business, the way I feel.’</p>

<p>‘What is it now?’</p>

<p>Still addressing the mirror, the younger man
outlined with some embarrassment that he hadn’t
been able to get over his ardor to tackle life on a
cattle range. The broad back before him suddenly
jerked about. Elbert was held by the first
direct look of one whose son has proved a definite
disappointment. Many words followed; some
heat:</p>

<p>‘... pack a pair of pistols! Step along out over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>the real-estate ranges and prairie sub-divisions!
Why, I’m actually ashamed to have to tell you,
what any kid half your age knows—that there
isn’t a West any more, no cattle country—hasn’t
been for—why, you’re only about thirty
years late—’ Also a final sentence, as Elbert
withdrew, to the effect that if he did go forth, he
would have to pay his own car fare ‘out into the
fenceless spaces.’</p>

<p>There was present at dinner that evening one
of sister Nancy’s young men friends, who had no
dreams of the West whatsoever. The Sartwell
family, diminished by recent marriages of two
elder daughters, was pulling together socially, in
spite of internal trouble. Elbert’s thoughts were
mainly afar on his own problem, but after a time,
he couldn’t help noticing the art with which the
gentleman-guest played up to his father. It could
be done, Elbert reflected. The two sons-in-law,
already connected up, had also gone about it this
way. He felt like a crossed stick; a spectator
merely, in the home dining-room. His glance
moved from face to face in the soft creamy light
that flowed down through a thin bowl of alabaster,
hanging from the ceiling. He alone, an only
son, lacked a sort of commonplace craft to smooth
his ways. He might have asked for a trip around
the world before settling down to a business
career—and gotten it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>Elbert retired to his room early. The Sartwell
mansion faced the West, and sunsets had reddened
his windows from as far back as he could
remember. Long ago he had stared into a crimson
foam of one certain day’s end, thinking that
it was the color of Wyoming. The lure of that
crimson foam hadn’t ceased, though it had moved
farther South and farther West—Apache country,
Navajo country—leading on over the border
of late into Mexico itself.</p>

<p>He had been given an automobile at the end
of high-school days, but he had wanted a pony.
Hours at home he had spent in the garage, secretly
wishing all the time it was a corral.</p>

<p>Elbert turned on the lights. Over the back of
the chair he was sitting on, was a blanket of
Indian red. There were framed Western drawings
on the wall, paintings of rodeo and round-up,
lonely cattlemen, bison, longhorns, desert and
mountain scenes; and in among his books, pasted
in an old ledger, was his collection of Indian
pictures—heads of all the tribes, famous braves
and medicine men—from cigarette, gum, candy
packages—no end to the lengths he had gone to
get the lot together. He looked back upon the
time when the bronzed head of Red Cloud, of the
Nez Perces, was the noblest countenance he had
ever gazed upon.</p>

<p>A tall, cool person, Elbert could hardly remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
ever being really tired. He was practically a
stranger to all stimulants and dwelt altogether
unaware in a calm that made nervous people
either envious at once or hopeless altogether.
His steady, homely hands were of that considerable
size as to appear empty most of the time,
and his blue eyes were so steady and cool that
any one undertaking to go against his will, felt a
surge of fatigue and irritation at the outset.</p>

<p>Elbert had been pondering a good deal of late
on what sort of stuff he was made of. When he
read of some hero’s exploits in a newspaper, he
asked himself could he have done that. And
when he heard of some great suffering or privation
of explorers, he wondered how he would
have acted, had he been along. But it was the
Southwest that perennially and persistently called.
He moved to his phonograph, and picked out a
book of records from the shelf below. The one he
wanted wasn’t there; in fact, he found it still in
the machine, from a solitary performance of last
evening—a Mexican record. He set it going now
and a man’s announcement in Spanish preceded
the music, something about ‘Paquita Conesa,
tonadillera española, la mas famosa en Mexico y
Sudamerica—’</p>

<p>... His favorite record. The song was ‘La
Paloma.’ It always seemed to Elbert as if Señorita
Paquita were singing in the open air. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>smiled at a secret thought that always came to
him, too—that the words of the song were
carved out of starlight.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">‘Cuando sali de la Habana,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Valgame Dios—’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Up from the street, at the end of the song,
reached his ears the tiresome sweep and swish of
tires and carbureters, and from the drawing-room,
Nancy’s singing voice. Her young man
would be standing beside the piano at this time,
his waxen hair brushed back. Elbert smiled wistfully.
‘Thirty years late.’</p>

<h2 id="II">II<br><br>
AT HEASLEP’S RANCH</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">From</span> Kansas City, he sent his first letter back,
regretting to leave home without talking it over
further, but there didn’t seem to be any use.
Possibly there wasn’t any more West, he allowed,
but he had to go out and see. He hopped off the
train at Tucson and heard of a stage that ran
south toward the Border. That sounded right,
and he walked three blocks with his bags to perceive—no
jehu with long flicking lash, but a
chauffeur, the stage being a motor-bus.</p>

<p>Elbert couldn’t appreciate the scenery. Yes,
there was a big ranch down yonder, the driver
said. Yes, there was cattle. Irrigation and alfalfa
had reclaimed this waste stuff. Some cows presently
appeared wearing an ‘HCO’ brand.</p>

<p>‘What does that stand for?’ Elbert asked.</p>

<p>‘Heaslep and Company.’</p>

<p>No Circle X or Lazy M—but irrigation, alfalfa
fields, Heaslep and Company!</p>

<p>‘The HCO runs everything down here—big
land grant stretching almost to the Border,’ the
stage driver said.</p>

<p>Elbert was let down and made his way to a
group of low buildings in the distance. At the
farrier’s shop, he inquired for the foreman, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>was told to look for a door ahead, marked ‘Office.’
‘You’ll find Frost-face in there or somewhere
about,’ the blacksmith said.</p>

<p>Elbert’s pulse picked up a little at the name of
the foreman, but it was certainly a business office
he entered.</p>

<p>‘We’re not short-handed,’ snapped the little
gray man, with worried face. ‘Things dull down
in winter. Nothin’ much to do right now but
keep off the hoof-and-mouth disease.’</p>

<p>Outside there was a succession of sick blasts
from a truck—the sound of an engine, not only
decrepit, but dirty and dry. Elbert turned to the
door.</p>

<p>‘Wait a minute, young fellow. We might use
a man on the chuck wagon—I wonder if you
could drive old Fortitude?’</p>

<p>‘A mule?’ said Elbert. ‘I’m sure I could
learn—’</p>

<p>‘Mule, hell, motor truck—can’t you hear her?’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid I can,’ Elbert said wearily. His
father had been right.</p>

<p>One distinct value about Heaslep and Company,
however—no women in the establishment.
Even the cooking staff was Chinese. But the rest
was hard to bear. Efficiency and trade had settled
down as unromantically as upon a tannery.
Heaslep’s was a stock farm, a beef factory, anything
but the cattle ranch of dreams. This part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>of Arizona was sunk in no foam of Indian red.
The vast range lay on a squat mesa, partly penciled
over with irrigation ditches. Elbert’s tardy
soul, longing for the thunder of a stampede, sickened
at the sight of thousands of domesticated
moos, rack-fed in winter, market-fattened from
fenced alfalfa fields, branded in chutes and railroaded
as scientifically as tinned biscuit. The
only longhorns hung over the mantelpiece in the
dormitory of the cowhands. Even the imported
bulls were businesslike.</p>

<p>Most of the ranges were deserted by this time,
the cold weather settling down. Elbert had been
taken on as ‘Bert’ Sartwell, but his first letters
from home gave the real thing away. All hands
relished the discovery. Over a dozen of the men
were in for his first Sunday, the day they started
him in filling up gopher holes in the environment
of the main buildings. Elbert was told that the
best way was to soak old newspapers into a pulp
and poke them down into the holes with a stick;
necessary business every week or ten days during
the gopher season. This was the height of it, he
was informed.</p>

<p>‘You see, the paper hardens down,’ Cal Monroid
said.</p>

<p>‘And gets fire-proof,’ added Slim Gannon, his
side-kick.</p>

<p>Elbert set about his work, a bit coldish and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>blank at the extent of the job before him. He had
never read of this department of ranch work, and
wondered if it meant he was to be relieved of the
motor truck. Toward midday he looked up from
his poking, to find that at least ten of the cowhands
had closed in, having stalked him like an
Indian band. Their enthusiasm was high and
prolonged. Elbert smiled and blushed, but said
nothing. For a day or two after that they tried
to call him ‘Poke,’ but the name didn’t take hold.
The men liked to say Elbert too well. ‘Elber-r-rt,’
they would chirrup, and inquire if he had ever
done any bull-dogging.</p>

<p>He was not relieved from the truck. His work
was to carry mails and bring in supplies from the
town of Harrisburg, eleven miles to the north.
He sometimes made two trips a day when the
truck would permit, but the tantrums of old Fortitude
were a subject of conversation at Heaslep’s
only a little lower in the scale than the hoof-and-mouth
disease.</p>

<p>On his third or fourth Sunday, Elbert spread
newspapers on the ground and set about taking
down Fortitude’s strained and creaking mechanism
part by part. His activity and absorption
began to attract a Sabbath crowd.</p>

<p>‘He’s gettin’ her whole plumbin’ out,’ Slim
Gannon remarked. ‘I’m layin’ four to three that
we’ve heard her last belch.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>Cal Monroid considered for half a minute, noting
the orderly lay-out of tools, inwards, greases
and oils, and how carefully Elbert had numbered
the parts. Cal began to fancy a vague purpose
underneath it all and casually remarked: ‘I’ll
just take you on, Slim, for half a month’s pay.’</p>

<p>Elbert toiled through the hours. By sundown
when he took his place at the wheel, all Heaslep’s
was taut with strain. The works purred, the car
moved. ‘It’s down-grade, she’s just rollin’!’
breathed Slim. But Elbert reversed; old Fortitude
backed and curved, did a figure eight to new
music without hitting post or wall.</p>

<p>‘I win,’ said Cal.</p>

<p>‘She ain’t belched yet,’ said Slim.</p>

<p>The two moved off to settle the technicality.</p>

<p>Dreary months of trucking. Elbert’s insatiable
interest in horsemanship had been little encouraged
at Heaslep’s. He was permitted to learn the
bad ones by experience, and was rapidly disconnected
several times, discovering his audience
when it was too late, as on the day of ‘poking’
gopher holes. Though it was generally allowed
things looked up a little when the range grass
began to grow, Elbert lost heart before the winter
was over. It seemed a long time to him since he
had left home, but it wasn’t so by the calendar.
To judge by letters, the family had its hands out
beckoning, but Elbert felt neither his father nor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>sisters would miss having the laugh at his expense.</p>

<p>Hard to leave Cal and Slim. This pair had
warmed up a trifle toward the last. It was Cal
Monroid who helped Elbert up from the turf the
last time he was spurned by an HCO untameable,
and Cal’s easy tones had a soothing effect:</p>

<p>‘It’s about time you were sitting a real horse,
Kid. Give me your shoe—’</p>

<p>And Elbert was lifted up on old Chester, who
had his ‘stuff’ down so fine, you wouldn’t believe
he knew anything. Chester was the morning-star
of Cal’s string, and right then Elbert began to
know the difference between an outlaw and a real
man-horse. That one brief word ‘Kid,’ still
sounded in his ears. It seemed to have let him
into a new world, the world of Cal Monroid and
Slim Gannon, the latter said to have taken the
Tucson Bronk Cup two years straight; both men
being held as cool and fast in a pinch. This episode
held the faintest possible answer to what he
had come West for, but Elbert had already decided
to depart, his plan being to go on to the
coast, before starting back East.</p>

THE LEATHER-STORE</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">His</span> first night in Los Angeles was like summer,
though it was February. In the core of the old
town he found the Plaza, and strolled through
the Mexican crowd. His heart started a queer
beat as the band struck up ‘La Paloma,’ his lips
forming the words of the first line or two:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Cuando sali de la Habana,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Valgame Dios—’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A wonder took him as to what Los Angeles
used to be like when there were empty hills
all around and how ‘La Paloma’ would have
sounded in those days. ‘Carved out of starlight,’
he whispered.</p>

<p>The next day in the window of an old leather-store
near the Plaza, he saw a cardboard sign
reading: ‘Young man wanted.’ Elbert didn’t
suppose they would take on one without experience,
but the impulse grew upon him to try his
luck. The thought of going East so soon hadn’t
become any easier, nor did he consider with relish
the idea of asking his father for money to stay
away with. To his surprise he was given a trial
in the leather-shop, and gradually he became
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>pleased with the arrangement, for the store proved
to have quality and background. Real cattlemen
used to swear by it, he found out, and occasionally,
even now, an old-timer would come in and
talk with the proprietor. They would chat of the
days when cantinas still welcomed the passer-by
around the corner on North Main Street, little
games going on upstairs. In those days the Mexicans
hanging around the Plaza still had bits of
color in their sashes and sombreros.</p>

<p>There was a gray wooden horse in the leather-store,
fragile but full height, on which Elbert was
accustomed to show bridles, saddles, blankets,
and pack-gear, talking to customers a lot wiser
than he felt, for he still resented life’s conspiracy
which had kept him from sitting a live horse
where he belonged.</p>

<p>In the evening he would go out and lounge in
the Plaza under the dusty palms and sycamores.
It was better than Heaslep’s in a way—the Mexicans
had a friendly feel, and sometimes when
the band played, he could imagine himself down
in the City of Mexico, or in the heart of Sonora
at least. One day during the dinner hour, when
Elbert was alone, a calm-eyed, oldish man pushed
ajar the door of the leather-store, looked slowly
around and remarked in mildest tone:</p>

<p>‘The first thing cow-people does, when they
don’t know what to do, is to saddle their pony.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>The voice was so gentle and leisurely, Elbert
was warmed and interested at once. He was
quite sure that nothing he could say about saddles
would astonish such a customer, so he approached
with a smile merely. The stranger had
come to a halt before as fine a bit of workmanship
in plain leather as the store contained.</p>

<p>‘It ain’t hem-stitched,’ he began reflectively.
‘Thirty-eight pounds.’</p>

<p>‘Would you like to see it on the model?’ Elbert
inquired.</p>

<p>The other didn’t seem to hear. ‘Now, what
would you expect me to lay out for a little tan
kack like this?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Hundred-seventy-five,’ Elbert said throatily.
‘Would you like to look at it on the model?’</p>

<p>‘No, it might confuse me a whole lot to see it
on your dappled gray. Anyway, I can see Buddy
Pitcairn made her from here. I’m shore partial
about him monogram when I fork leather.’</p>

<p>A check was written with the remark: ‘You
can ship her to me, care of Mort Cotton’s ranch
at San Forenso, Arizona, and take plenty of time
to look up this paper, young man. I never feel
sure that the bank will like it, when I write out
money for myself.’</p>

<p>The easy, rapid writing hinted an intelligence
in curious contrast to the quaint speech and big
loose hands, blackened and rounded to tool handles.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
The name on the check was Robert Leadley,
and that was but the first of several calls
which this customer made at the leather-store,
ostensibly for further purchases, but always lingering
to talk with Elbert. The latter had never
known any one so easy to be with, and one late
afternoon at closing time, when Mr. Leadley,
with embarrassment, invited him to go out to
supper, Elbert had been on the point of asking
the same thing. They stopped for a soft drink at
an old brown rail in Main Street.</p>

<p>‘I ’member when this was a great sportin’
place,’ Mr. Leadley said. ‘I used to come in here
from the mountains with gold in a little chamois
sack. Had a California claim in those days. I’m
back in Arizona now, not a great ways from
where I began. When the time came for me to
go out this last trip, I felt like coming over to
L.A., just like I used to from these mountains.
Why, I was in this very place one night when a
man was shot. Just yonder by that plate of hard-boiled
eggs, he went down, callin’ on a woman.’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t quite understand what you mean by
“going out,”’ said Elbert, not wanting to miss
anything.</p>

<p>‘When you’ve got a claim in the mountains
and you figure on leaving, you designates it “going
out.”’</p>

<p>‘Is it a gold mine?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>‘Well, by stretchin’ a trifle you might call her
a gold mine—just a little claim by myself.
Southeast a ways and high up. You go to San
Forenso first. You can look back into California
and down into Sonora from my diggin’s.’</p>

<p>‘Do you have horses up at the mine?’ Elbert
asked, thinking of the Pitcairn stock-saddle.</p>

<p>The quaint laugh sounded. ‘Just a little vanity,
young man. They do say Bob Leadley would
have his saddle-hoss, if he was runnin’ a canal
boat. I can’t seem to do proper without a bit of
hoss-flesh handy, though Mamie sure costs me no
end money and trouble, not bein’ the sort of hoss
as can pick her livin’ off the north side o’ trees—’</p>

<p>He paused, as if pleased to recall the mare to
mind in minutest detail.</p>

<p>‘Mamie’s father was the stake-hoss, Ganopol—one
of the first ten runners, they do say, and
bone and blood to go with it, if not a whole lot of
hoss-sense essential. Mamie’s mother was just a
cow hoss ... just a cow hoss, with a little clock
workin’ between her eyes—that was Clara.
Thirteen years, I had her, and we got real domesticated
together, you might say. Mamie’s a five-year-old
now—just about growed up—don’t
resemble neither parent none, bein’ a jewel box
by herself, full of her own little knick-knacks....
Yep, bred right out of the purple royalty on one
hand and the black sage on the other, but approachin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
my idea of saddle-hoss, plumb satisfyin’—</p>

<p>‘An’ p’raps it ain’t such a chore, as I’m makin’
out, to get hay and grain up to the mine,’ Mr.
Leadley added, ‘because once or twice a year,
Mort Cotton sends his mule train up from San
Forenso to pack down my ore. Takes just about
a week’s work, three times a year, for a dozen or
fourteen mules; and ’stead of the train pilin’ back
uptrail with empty riggin’s, I stock up the cabin
and the corral. Makes it easy, but a whole lot of
times, I don’t know where to put all I got—’</p>

<p>‘But what do you do with your mare when you
leave the mine?’ Elbert asked.</p>

<p>‘Leave her with Mort Cotton at his ranch in
San Forenso. All hands have got to know her at
Mort’s.’</p>

<p>After supper they strolled back to the Plaza.
The band began playing ‘La Paloma.’ Elbert
started to speak, but Mr. Leadley’s hand tightened
on his knee for silence.</p>

<p>‘I’ve got reason to remember that piece,’ he
said, when it was over. ‘The Mexicans never get
tired of it. It’s like the Virgin speaking to them.
Do you know what that word means?’</p>

<p>‘Dove,’ said Elbert.</p>

<p>‘Correct. You must have studied the language?’</p>

<p>‘Only the last few weeks. I’d like to know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>more. It would come handy in the leather-store.
You know a lot about Mexico, don’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Not so much as I used to believe, young man,
but I ain’t averse to these people. I used to think
I was, but as I look back now, I ’casionally catch
myself wishin’ I’d treated them as well as they
have treated me. Just a curious feelin’ at times—’</p>

<p>It didn’t seem to be a deep matter to Mr. Leadley,
his eyes were so pleasant.</p>

<p>‘They’re peaceful to be with, like cattle,’ he
went on. ‘I lived on a farm back East when I was
a boy, and my father and mother used to fight a
whole lot—at supper, especially. I ’member
often goin’ out in the barnyard, and how peaceful
it was, after the supper table. I don’t mean
Mexicans are cattle, you understand, only that
they loll around and ruminate peaceful, like
cattle.’</p>

<p>Elbert waited for more, and what came had a
world of feeling in it that he didn’t understand.
It seemed the night was chillier, but the gentle
tone hadn’t changed.</p>

<p>‘We used to call ’em greasers and shoot ’em
up a lot, not thinkin’ much about it. We used
to hang ’em for hoss-thieves, when a sheriff
wanted to make a showin’. Thought little more
of ’em than a Chinee, only diff’rent. Young
punchers and miners—we thought we was the
people—’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>The voice stopped so suddenly Elbert felt
queer.</p>

<p>‘You didn’t tell me, why you have reason to
remember “La Paloma,”’ he said, looking across
at the red lights of ‘Estella Teatro.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve got a boy about your size, I figure, somewhere
south in Sonora—’</p>

<p>The words fanned to life the romantic pictures
of Elbert’s private world—‘somewhere south in
Sonora—’</p>

<p>‘He used to like that song—used to whistle
and sing it at all times. A dozen years since I saw
him. He was under fifteen then—that would
make him about your age now. You’re pretty
good size, but I think he’d show up a speck taller
by this time.’</p>

<p>‘What’s your son doing down there?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I only hear from him occasionally, through
the papers. Must be excitin’ work, having to do
with the rurales, mostly. Some calls it politics in
Mexico.... Maybe they’ll play that again—if
we sit down for a spell.’</p>

<p>And now Elbert was hearing the story of a boy,
called Bart—no mother—life in a mining camp
on the Rio Brava, Arizona—a sorry sort of helpless
attachment in the father.</p>

<p>‘The very night Bart came to town, before
even the old Mexican nurse let me in, I knew my
job was cut out,’ Mr. Leadley said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>
<p>Sentences like these stood out in the midst of
detail:</p>

<p>‘I had everything mapped out for him, but he
wouldn’t follow the map. That broke me, because
I mapped so hard and set so much store....
Bit by bit Bart showed me he’d have his way—taking
his whippings easy, looking white, but
ready to laugh, and going his own way just the
same afterward. I never seemed able to do the
right thing by him; couldn’t let him alone; cared
too much, I guess—the kind of care that hurts.
Why, I’d get lonesome for him when he was right
in the room, and flare up over things I’d never
dream of getting sore about in any one else. Altogether,
what I didn’t know in them days was so
much, young man, that I’ve been fillin’ in ever
since, and ain’t through yet.’</p>

‘ARE YOU DOOMED?’</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">After</span> they had parted, on the night of their first
supper together, Elbert fell to thinking of his own
relationships at home. This occupied him for an
hour or two before going to bed—mixed in with
memories of what he had heard about Mr. Leadley’s
missing son, and old days on the Rio Brava.
He saw for the first time that there were two sides
to this father-and-son business; that it was just
possible a man might be able to talk to another
man, saying things he couldn’t tell his own son.
Moreover, Elbert was able to see something of
the tangle between Bart and his father with a
clearness that had never come to him in regard to
his own affairs.</p>

<p>He was a touch lonely that night, but queerly
glad, for the first time, that he had never shown
the knack to ‘work’ his father. All regret eased
about that; better as it was.</p>

<p>Mr. Leadley didn’t appear to be in any hurry
to get back to his mine. It seemed to do him good
to talk about the old days. Elbert listened
eagerly, especially about Bart as a horseman.</p>

<p>‘You see, he learned all we knew about hosses
and all that the Mexicans know besides. He rode
light, his hand quick, a sort of kidding way with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>him that got right into the good feelings of a hoss.
I made him give up a bad one once and I had no
right to do that, but I didn’t see it straight until
afterward. It was an old gray outlaw he brought
home from a near-by ranch—a discard, but Bart
was sitting him upright and amiable. That hoss
pretty near finished me. I’m limpin’ yet, on
rainy days, from tryin’ to correct his misdemeanors.
And because I couldn’t, it bore down
on me not to let Bart ride him, who could. That
was another mistake.... A hossman at ten, Bart
was; had to have his six-gun before he was twelve.
He could fan it, too. No use me tryin’ to keep
him from it, and the fellows I worked with at the
mines whisperin’ that he’d kill himself—that he
wouldn’t live to be hanged. You always hear
what you’re afraid of.</p>

<p>‘Slim, black-haired, easy smilin’ and Spanish
on his tongue, Mexican spurs and reata, more
interested in guitar music than gold mining, and
off by himself or with the Mexicans instead of
with his own kind. You know, Bart’s mother was
Spanish.... Yet any one could see Bart was
game and gritty—life a feather to him—take
it or leave it; laughin’ but dangerous. No, they
couldn’t see it, either,’ Mr. Leadley finished
abruptly. ‘I’m talking from a distance, from
where I am now, I didn’t see it myself then—not
rightly, I didn’t. I’m shore gettin’ talkative.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>‘I like to hear about him,’ said Elbert.</p>

<p>‘Now as to that, I had a queer feelin’ you did
from the first day I came to the leather-store.
Guess that’s why I’ve kept hangin’ around—that,
and your bein’ about Bart’s age and size.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And yet, if it hadn’t been for the curious sensitiveness
within him that registered Mr. Leadley’s
feelings, Elbert would have thought that the
other was merely recalling matters of pleasantness
from years ago. Finally one evening, after
talk touching Bart’s prolonged stay below the
Border, Elbert said:</p>

<p>‘I’d certainly like to get somewhere down in
Sonora.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you ever draw a vacation at your
store?’</p>

<p>Elbert laughed. ‘I’ve only been there a few
weeks.’</p>

<p>‘I’d hate to cause any disaster in the leather
business—’</p>

<p>‘How do you mean?’</p>

<p>The other’s voice became husky with strain.
‘I was thinkin’ as a starter, possibly, you might
come over to my claim on your vacation.’</p>

<p>It began to appear more and more feasible as
they talked. Directions opened right here at the
Plaza. Elbert was told that an old friend and
mining partner of Mr. Leadley’s—Mort Cotton,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>now a cattleman, the same to whom the saddle
had been shipped—would meet him at San
Forenso and drive him up as far as the road went
on the way to the mine.</p>

<p>‘That’s at Slim Stake Camp,’ Mr. Leadley
added. ‘From there you just keep on hikin’ up
the canyon trail till you come to White Stone
Flats, where I’ll be watchin’ for you—’</p>

<p>It sounded somewhat complicated to Elbert.
‘But suppose I should miss the trail?’ he said.</p>

<p>‘I can’t see how you could, unless you got
headstrong—’</p>

<p>‘But how am I to know when I get to White
Stone Flats?’</p>

<p>‘By composin’ yourself to listen a little longer.
First you see two big pines less’n twenty feet
apart, still alive, but showing marks of a forest
fire ten or twelve years back.’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid I wouldn’t know how a tree would
look, twelve years after a forest fire—’</p>

<p>‘Right, you wouldn’t, but that ain’t all to go
by. It is a Flats, remember, and on the Flats is a
lot of big white stones, and printed on the biggest
of ’em in black letters, “<span class="smcap">Are You Doomed?</span>”’</p>

<p>Elbert saw himself getting there.</p>

<p>‘... humorist—now I wonder?’ Mr. Leadley
went on. ‘Or just a pious gent coming up
into Nineveh, as if sent for? “Are You Doomed?”—he
paints, right on the big stone facin’ the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>trail, and a little ways off on a smaller stone, he
fixes the answer: “<span class="smcap">Jesus Saves</span>.” That there
handwritin’ on the rock seems to be for me,
’cause every time I go for water—there it is.
But as I was sayin’, you’ll know you’re comin’
to the Flats when you get to the last water.’</p>

<p>‘How shall I know it’s the last water?’</p>

<p>‘’Cause pretty soon after that you’ll come to
the Flats. Anyway, I’d be watchin’ on the day
set—’</p>

<p>Elbert was finally able to arrange a few days
off, without losing his job outright, though he
felt queerly uncertain about coming back, the
claim being beyond Yuma on his way East. On
a morning in late March, he reached San Forenso,
where he was met by Mr. Cotton, with a two-horse
rig. The hand that Elbert gripped was crippled
in shape, but did not lack strength, and the
eyes of Mr. Leadley’s old partner peered into his
with such frequency and deep intent from under
their bushy white brows, that Elbert began to
feel he had never before been so exhaustively
appraised.</p>

<p>‘Has Bob started in tellin’ you about Red
Ante, yet?’ Mr. Cotton asked after they had
driven some time.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Elbert, wondering if Red Ante were
a game.</p>

<p>‘Now that’s funny—he never gets away from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>that when I see him. That’s one reason I don’t
see him a whole lot more. Told you about Bart,
of course—’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Way back in Bismo—’</p>

<p>‘Yes—’</p>

<p>‘And stopped short at Red Ante?’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t hear him mention—’</p>

<p>‘Now that’s queer—nothin’ about a man not
bein’ able to wash his hands?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Elbert, more mystified.</p>

<p>‘Can’t be it’s dyin’ out of him,’ Mr. Cotton
mused, eyes rigid on the flanks of his team, as
they wound up a canyon trail. ‘But that ain’t
the kind of thing as dies out,’ he added.</p>

<p>At Slim Stake Camp, where the road ended,
Mr. Cotton excused himself to write a note to
Mr. Leadley, which Elbert was asked to deliver.
‘And don’t let him fill you up none on how bad
he’s treated Bart,’ was the last swift injunction.
‘I was along myself in them days and I didn’t
miss all that was goin’ on.’</p>

<p>Elbert nodded attentively.</p>

<p>‘Remember what I say, when he starts tellin’
you about Red Ante!’ shouted Mr. Cotton, holding
hard on his swerving team.</p>

<p>A while after that Elbert was alone on the steep
canyon trail, his ears cracking like drying wallpaper
from the altitude, and his heart windily at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>work. Springs saturated the earth from time to
time. There positively didn’t seem to be any last
water, until the trail widened in mid-afternoon
and there faced him:</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Are You Doomed?</span>’</p>

<p>White Stone Flats. He found the two pines
that had lived through the fire—all straight, but
no Mr. Leadley to meet him. He called a little,
but the raising of his voice left him queerly uneasy.
There was food in his roll, and he finally
spread his blankets and stretched out for the
night. The idea struck him that he must soon get
back to work, for it seemed like ten days already.</p>

<p>Mr. Leadley must have forgotten the date. Up
here anything was possible. Hours after, a white
glare through the eastern trees and a tardy, bulging
moon showed up; then quite the most curdling
wail sounded through the whitish night. It
was ‘doggy’ in depth and volume, but the wauling
of it was like a greatly enlarged cat. Now
Elbert had an opportunity to study the stuff he
was made of. He wasn’t encouraged. His heart
was knocking to get out. Nothing short of a
mountain lion made that noise.</p>

<p>There was another sound—hard to place, that
welled out of the dragging hours—a queer hum,
so soft that one didn’t know whether it was a mile
away or in his hair. It was like a woman going
insane, but not violently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>Hard to believe, but the sky began to show
signs at last that another day was actually to be
given to mankind. Elbert was making coffee in
full daylight, when another outcry reached him—his
first dawning suspicion as to the human
quality of these tones. He stood up; his hand
actually shook as he set down his tin cup, and his
eye caught the black letters:</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Are You Doomed?</span>’</p>

<p>‘How did you know?’ he muttered—and
right then, the call again—vaguely like his own
name. A minute later he was running across the
Flats, his ears verifying as he ran:</p>

<p>‘Oh, Sartwell—this wa-a-ay!’ ahead, and
somewhat above.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I’m coming!’</p>

<p>On the easy slope before his eyes, he saw a
trail.</p>

<p>‘... turn to the left at the rotted cedar!’</p>

<p>The voice nearer, his own steps soundless for
sixty or seventy feet along the punk of fallen
timber; then a bald ridge which the winds had
swept clean—a hand raised from the gravel—the
old man crumpled there, his lips stretched
white in a pained smile.</p>

<p>‘A long time gettin’ to you ... couldn’t make
it last night. Where’s your canteen?’</p>

<p>‘Back with my stuff—shall I get it?’</p>

<p>‘No, I guess I can wait a little longer. We’ll
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>get to the cabin. Mebby, leaning a whole lot, I
can walk a bit.’</p>

<p>‘What did you do? You haven’t been lying
out here all night?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. It happened in the tunnel yesterday
’bout noon—falling rock ... too big for the
small of a man’s back. Started a trickle in there,
somewhere—’</p>

<p>Did he mean in the mine or in his back?</p>

<p>‘Left me uncoupled. Too bad to spoil that
vacation of yours this way.... Figured I could
reach you by crawlin’—but played out—couldn’t
make you hear in the night. Feared you
might have gone back to town.’</p>

<p>Mr. Leadley couldn’t stand now, even with
help. Elbert shouldered him at last; a long hard
pull up to the cabin. No need for directions the
latter part of the way, for a horse kept up an incessant
nickering—like showers of gold coins
falling upon a metal surface.</p>

<p>‘That’s Mamie. She ain’t been fed since yesterday
mornin’,’ the old man apologized. ‘She
never misses bestowin’ her welcomes, though it
ain’t like her to be quite so noisy. She’s a real
listener, too, Mamie is.’</p>

<p>A cabin in the midst of a group of great yellow
pines. Elbert entered the open door, gasping with
his burden. The old man’s tortured mouth still
smiled up at him from the bunk. The room
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>smelled like cigar-box wood. It was stuffed with
chests, cupboards and cabinets—a hand-hewn
room, with massive frame and heavy cedar shakes
on the outside. Elbert brought water and started
to unlace the nearest boot.</p>

<p>A ghost of the old chuckle and the words:</p>

<p>‘No, nothing for me, ’til you go feed Mamie.
She ain’t used to bein’ treated like this—’</p>

<p>Half in a dream, Elbert went out to the little
corral, lifting the wooden pin that let him in. The
mare played curiously about him, but mainly
kept her eyes to the cabin; her ears straight out
for a voice from there. He only saw a bay butterball
at first—shiny satin in the bright sunlight—a
lot more rounded out than the wooden horse
in the leather-store, not so tall as Cal Monroid’s
Chester, which had stood in Elbert’s mind up to
this moment as all that a horse could be.</p>

<p>He was thinking of the look he had seen in Bob
Leadley’s face; and of the rock, too big for the
small of a man’s back, and of feeding the mare
before anything could be done. He dropped a
measure of grain into the manger under the shed
roof, but Mamie didn’t stay with it. She kept
running up and down the corral, nickering softly,
listening, her head cocked toward the cabin, her
ears held forward pointing to the open door. She
seemed appareled in sunshine.</p>

‘I, ROBERT LEADLEY—’</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">That</span> leak wasn’t in the mine.</p>

<p>‘I feel a trickle inside, young man—’</p>

<p>Thus, every little while, through the heat of
the day, the old man intimated his hurt, and how
he felt himself bleeding internally. Elbert’s idea
was to set out at once and in a hurry to bring
help from Slim Stake Camp, but Mr. Leadley so
far had persistently refused to let him go.</p>

<p>‘Things I’ve got to say are more important.
You never can tell when I’m apt to start talkin’—don’t
go yet. I’m restin’ a little first, that’s
all—’</p>

<p>When he dozed, Elbert roamed about outside,
but within call. Everything imaginable in the
way of canned goods, dried fruits, preserves, were
stored in a shed as commodious as the cabin;
ample supplies of tobacco, quantities of unused
tools. Stocked for a year, the place looked; with
at least a ton of baled hay and many bags of
grain in the corral-shed. All the carpenter work
was made of cedar; hand-tooling everywhere—work
of a man who liked to bring out the best
with a sharp blade; quaint art about the cabinets
and wooden insets in the fireplace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>Down trail to the right from the cabin door
was the tunnel entrance to the mine, and ahead
out over many tree-tops, a glimpse of the Flats,
in a great pit of saffron light. Elbert kept thinking
he should go for help in spite of Mr. Leadley’s
protestations. A call from the cabin hurried him
in shortly after noon.</p>

<p>Twice the injured man’s lips started, before he
got words going:</p>

<p>‘Maybe I ain’t goin’ to die, and maybe I am.
That’s all right—only there’s some things I mean
to say first. It wasn’t only a vacation I brought
you here for—that and somethin’ else, though I
didn’t expect to be hurried like this, in unburdenin’
my mind. Yes, sir, I took to you the minute
you looked so inquirin’ as to what I meant,
when I came in that leather-store ... same age
and all that, as Bart down in Sonora—and when
you hints you’d like to get down there .... Draw
up a box to write on, and bring me a little leather
sack of papers in the lower cabinet by the fireplace—the
key in the wallet here. You’re to
write down what I say.’</p>

<p>Reserves of will-power were drawn upon; part
of the quaint twang went out of the old man’s
speech:</p>

<p>‘I, Robert Leadley, of the Dry Cache mine,
near San Forenso, Arizona, in sound mind, so far
as I know, but badly hurt from a fallen rock in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>the tunnel of said mine—my own fault because
I knew for a long time there were spots that
needed timbering—do hereby confer upon my
young friend, Elbert Sartwell, who is writing this
at my word, the sole right and authority to manage
and administer all property I possess—’</p>

<p>Elbert had no chance to interrupt. The enumeration
went on without a break, including the
Dry Cache mine, saddle-horse, all goods stored in
cabin and corral-shed, bank-books, documents
and keys to a lock-box in the San Forenso Bank—amounting
to about ninety thousand dollars,
Mr. Leadley explaining that he had refused an
offer of seventy-five thousand dollars for the mine
itself.</p>

<p>‘Don’t sell in a hurry,’ he broke in. ‘There’s a
gold tooth in her head. Mort Cotton understands.
You can tell that to Bart—’</p>

<p>‘I tell Bart—’</p>

<p>‘That’s the general idea—’</p>

<p>‘But how do you mean, Mr. Leadley?’</p>

<p>‘Because Mort Cotton can’t go—I’ve talked
to him—and administerin’ property isn’t his
line. It’s—it’s because I took to you—that’s
the main reason. Listen on—let me get it all
out straight.’</p>

<p>Gradually it appeared that Mr. Leadley’s desire
was to leave the bulk of what he possessed to
his only son, Bart Leadley, now somewhere in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>Sonora, Mexico, at large, and Elbert’s work to
find same. Elbert was to be identified by Mr.
Cotton who would help him through business of
bank and possible probate, and answer all questions
as to why the property could not be left and
arranged for in the usual way. A generous salary
and expense account was provided, and on the
day Bart Leadley was brought back to the States,
Elbert was at liberty to assign to himself a one-fifth
interest in the Dry Cache mine; a second
one fifth to go to Mort Cotton, memo of which
was on separate paper, and three fifths to the
son, Bart Leadley.</p>

<p>Elbert’s eye was held to the page, after this was
written, his mind so lost in what it all meant,
that the voice from the bunk actually startled
after a silence:</p>

<p>‘Well, how about it, young man—does the
paper stand?’</p>

<p>‘But—in case your son isn’t to be found—at
least, from anything I can do?’</p>

<p>‘All you have to do is convince Mort Cotton
of the facts, and the whole business then lies between
you and him. There’s nobody else.’</p>

<p>Elbert went to the door to breathe, more astonished
than ever before in his life; astonished and
hurt, too, by the reality of this friendliness, and
the mystery of the smiling courage with which
Mr. Leadley bore his pain. Sonora—to find
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>Bart Leadley at large in Sonora—expenses to
draw from—an interest in the mine. His eyelids
narrowed as he turned from the corral, where
the mare stood listening in the vivid afternoon
light.</p>

<p>Then presently he saw, stretched from one
branch of scrub-oak to another, between him and
the corral gate, a shining thread that hung and
waved in the sunlight. Just a spider’s suspension
cable, but a deep meaning now about that connecting
thread; so thin one wouldn’t see at all,
if the sun hadn’t been shining just right. Mr.
Leadley had trusted him, felt drawn to him, even
before the accident in the shaft—mysterious
threads binding people together. Why, that must
have been the meaning of his taking the job in
the leather-store. The voice called from behind:</p>

<p>‘But Bart Leadley isn’t dead! I don’t feel he’s
dead,’ Mr. Leadley said, when Elbert hurried in.
‘No, you won’t be able to go for a doctor just
yet—little later for that, maybe. The paper’s
done, but there’s something to tell about Red
Ante before you go—and, yes, about Mamie.
I’m giving her to you outright, not that Bart
isn’t a horseman—he’s that before everything
else—but you might be a long time findin’ him,
and I don’t want her to change hands too often.
And then you’re the one who’ll need her in
Sonora.... Don’t try to run her, young man.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>Just try to come to an understanding. Stand
around and talk to her—she’s one more listenin’
mare. She likes to be consulted about family
affairs. It won’t do you no harm. And don’t
ever tie her up, when you camp in the open.
She’ll graze within range and keep an eye on you
besides, like her mother used to. You’ll get the
hang of each other. Keep on her right side, and
whistle when you want her—’</p>

<p>He put two fingers to his lips to show how.
Elbert couldn’t make a sound that way. He
thought of getting a whistle to carry.</p>

<p>As dusk thickened, a wind stirred across high
country—sometimes the sound of a waterfall,
sometimes the sound of the sea in the top
branches of big timber. The mountains grew
heavy on Elbert’s heart with the falling night.
Meanwhile he was encouraged to bake a honey-cake
for his own supper.</p>

<p>‘No, you don’t need salt nor sodie—all that’s
in the flour—just can-milk and honey in the
batter, an’ grease on the pan.... Not too near
the coals, an’ keep turnin’ her round and round.
You’ll have a cake yet, young man, and what
you have over you can feed Mamie to-morrow.
She’ll like it, if it’s good.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>‘Just a trickle—’</p>

<p>Elbert heard the words from time to time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>through the first half of the night. Then for a
while delirium was unmistakable:</p>

<p>‘<i>You didn’t have to go, Bart—</i>’ the voice once
said in a wistful tone, and names were uttered
with dread, yet a kind of life-long familiarity as
well: ‘Welton—Letchie Welton.’ ... ‘Palto’
... ‘Mort Cotton’ ... ‘Red Ante’ and in and
out through sustained incoherencies, with dreadful
impressiveness, references to a blacksmith
shop: and once starting up, the old man found
Elbert’s eyes and spoke slowly with intolerable
contrition:</p>

<p>‘<i>There are times when you can’t wash your
hands, I’m sayin’. It wasn’t what I did—but
what I didn’t do!</i>’</p>

<p>Toward daylight he slept, but it was only for
an hour or so. Elbert, drowsing in a chair, heard
the call.</p>

<p>‘Start some coffee for yourself, and turn in a
measure of grain for Mamie; then draw your
chair close. You’ll be goin’ down trail for a doctor
this morning—I know it’s bearin’ heavy on
you, and maybe there won’t be much talkin’ after
the doctor comes.’</p>

<p>Altogether quiet and hasteless—so different
from the delirium of the night. It was dim and
cool in the cabin; the sun not yet over the ridge;
fragrant firelight, coffee on to boil.</p>

<p>‘You can telephone Mort, too, from the lower
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>camp. He wouldn’t like it, if I didn’t let him
know, and bring your coffee here.... Yep, sit in
close.’</p>

<p>At times it seemed as if the old man were easing
a burden from his heart, as gradually Elbert
began to get it all straight: The mining town of
Bismo, Arizona, one morning twelve years ago;
an old storekeeper, murdered in the night—young
Bart hanging around, though sent back—Bart
following the posse and being permitted to
stay by the marshal when they were ten miles
out.</p>

<p>Elbert had to be reminded of his coffee as the
story of the three days’ chase carried on—hunger,
thirst, fatigue: how one of the Mexicans split,
breaking up the pursuing party also—Letchie
Welton, Mort Cotton, Bob Leadley and his son
Bart continuing straight south, four others turning
east. Then it was that the telling took on an
unprecedented intensity, though the voice was
held low.</p>

<p>‘Over a hundred miles from Bismo, and just
before dark, coming to water and an abandoned
town called Red Ante. Bart ridin’ light and easy;
the rest of us done for, my horse dyin’ under me,
ears loppin’, the weight of his head hangin’ on my
arm. I’d ridden him to death—that made me
all the uglier.... Gettin’ dark, as I say, and we
halted at the edge of that dusty hell-hole, everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
saggin’ and sand-blown.... Palto—our
work wasn’t over—’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>‘But what did they do to him?’ Elbert burst
out a moment later; yet he was afraid to hear.
The cabin interior had taken on a startling unreality.
He seemed to be back in Red Ante ...
the lone sandy road that nightfall twelve years
ago. Then the quiet words:</p>

<p>‘Recollect what I told you was in the blacksmith
shop?’</p>

<p>Elbert moved to the door, his eyelids narrowed
by the sunlight. He was ill, intolerably shaken,
but the weary voice followed him.</p>

<p>‘I know it ain’t pleasant to hear, young man.
It ain’t been pleasant to live through—that
night, nor for a dozen years. It don’t get no better,
but you’ve got to know. And there’s only a
little more—’</p>

<p>Elbert braced for the rest. What called his
will-power to bear it was that he was only listening
to a story a dozen years later, and this man
had lived through the action of it—had heard
the sounds—had lost his boy—just a note
pinned to the saddle, all that was left.</p>

<p>The old man turned his face away.</p>

<p>‘I guess that’s about talk enough from me
right now,’ he said after a moment, ‘only that
when we got back to Bismo, they entered a murder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
charge against Bart. ‘Mebbe it was murder
Letchie,’ Mort Cotton said at the hearin’, ‘but
the most merciful bullet I ever heard fired, was
that one of Bart’s just ’fore he rid out of Red
Ante.’ But no words of Mort’s or mine did any
good.... You can go down trail now. Mort’ll
tell you the rest, if I don’t get to it—’</p>

<h2 id="VI">VI<br><br>
THE LISTENING MARE</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Two</span> weeks later Elbert was closing up the cabin.
He had been through all the papers. There was
one having to do with the lineage of Ganopol, a
running horse, with lines tracing back to Europe
and the Near East, and the days when man and
horse were mates of the world. Names—feminine
names of the desert like those of the Old
Testament, for the horse-lines of Araby were kept
from mother to daughter and not from father to
son—‘The Listening Mares.’ There were sweet
meadow names of England ... there was a remark
in pencil on one corner of the big sheet:</p>

<p>‘Her pedigree isn’t any longer than a piece of
burnt string, and where she got herself from, I’m
not prepared to state, but for a horse to sit on
and come across with good sense, little Mamie’s
mother, old Clara, was sure a triumph of breeding—’</p>

<p>It was almost like a voice. Elbert turned his
eyes to the empty cot. It was as if he could see
Mr. Leadley looking over the certificate of registration
and writing down that remark—not
having any one to speak aloud to. A lot of talk
about Mamie’s father—too much silence about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>old Clara, he had probably thought. A little later
as Elbert touched a match to some papers in the
fireplace, these brief but laborious lines caught
his eye:</p>

<p>‘... On looking him over at your request, Bob,
I don’t feel troubled about his honesty, but I’m
not so sure he’s real bright.’</p>

<p>It was the letter he had brought up trail from
Mort Cotton that first day at San Forenso. Another
proof that Mr. Leadley had been thinking
of sending him down into Sonora for Bart, before
the accident in the shaft. He had asked his old
partner’s judgment. This reminded Elbert of
Mr. Cotton’s first fierce appraisal of him in San
Forenso. A low nicker reached him from the corral
and a flushed smile came to his face, as he
moved out.</p>

<p>Somehow in lifting the wooden pin of the cedar
gate, the sense came over him again of the quality
of the man whom he had known so well—just
a pin of manzanito to hold the gate, but
there was an art about the way the knots were
cut. The mare came up to him nodding and stepping
high with her front feet. She seemed to say
that this conspiracy to keep her in the dark had
gone far enough; that the time had come for her
to know what was going on.</p>

<p>‘... And you’re to be mine, Mamie—from
now on!’ Elbert muttered. He had been trying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>to get used to it for days. ‘What do you think
about that? Not very much, I guess.... Not
much more than Mort Cotton did, probably.’</p>

<p>The mare wasn’t telling. She was friendly,
however, nudging under the arm, nosing at his
hands and pockets.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I know what you want—a piece of cake.’</p>

<p>He went back to the cabin. The strangest feeling
came over him in the shadows. This was his
place to come and go in, but the fact was slow to
settle in him. He missed his old friend and didn’t
feel quite up to the reality of possession. One
man’s whole life—these things represented—and
a mare that couldn’t be bought.... There
might have been some hope, the doctor had repeatedly
suggested, if Mr. Leadley could have
been moved down to San Forenso, but the old
man had refused to hear to that. He had to come
to his own conclusion, apparently. Days of just
sitting around—Mort Cotton there, the doctor
riding up to the claim every day—about as hard
days as the young man had lived through so far.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The last chest was locked, the last cabinet.</p>

<p>Elbert glanced around before shutting and
padlocking the outer door of the cabin—a wonder
passing through him about sometime coming
back—with Bart.... In a sense, this meant his
start for Sonora right now. Of course, there were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>matters to close up in San Forenso—affairs of
the Dry Cache, of banks, papers and probate, but
Mamie was now to be ridden down trail and it
was like the beginning of a new life. From the
doorway, he studied the mare’s sculptured head.
There she stood, as if listening to sounds which
she alone could detect.</p>

<p>Practically his first experience in saddling anything
but the wooden horse. The horses he had
failed to tarry on at Heaslep’s had been saddled
by others—even old Chester on that unforgettable
day. He knew the straps and cinches—part
of his recent business, and Mamie wasn’t too
restive, so far. Funny, Elbert thought, that he
should have sold that Pitcairn stock-saddle to
himself, after all.</p>

<p>‘Thirty-eight pounds,’ he muttered.</p>

<p>Trouble came to Mamie’s eyes as he undertook
to tuck the steel between her teeth. She didn’t
like the way he went about it; also it seemed, he
had to mash her ears about to get the bridle on.
She was nervous as a child being severely washed.
Finally the man got his foot in the stirrup and
raised himself. With a little dance to the right,
the mare glided from under, and stood with trailing
bridle-rein, looking at him, confused and incredulous.</p>

<p>‘I guess I couldn’t have stepped up on her in
the way she’s used to,’ he remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>He tried again. Mamie seemed to have a certain
responsibility for him this time, like a mother-hen
trying to get on with an unfamiliar chick.
But she had her own mysterious forces and impulses
to cope with, too. She had been penned-in
for altogether too many days and darted out of
the corral gate with a suddenness that jerked
the man’s body and arm back to keep his place.
Mamie’s head flung upward in utter dismay, and
the awfulness of having put weight like that on her
tender mouth, uncentered Elbert entirely for the
time. It was like clashing gears in a fine machine
that has been desperately hard to obtain—only
ten times—infinitely worse—this, a living thing,
cherished from a baby by an old man who had
been a horseman all his days.</p>

<p>The saddle kept slipping forward. Elbert hadn’t
known at first how to tighten the girths. He
didn’t dare to look underneath. At least, there
was no blood mixed with the foam around the
steel of her bit.... Twenty-two miles down trail,
and long before the end, his own agony took the
edge of strain from the fierce imaginings of damage
he was doing the mare. Mamie didn’t stop
to walk; she danced down trail—to friends of
hers at Mort Cotton’s ranch. It was as if she
expected, when she got there, to hear the voice
that had been silent so long. A hundred times
Elbert thought of this. His bones crunched; he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>felt the scald of blood and sweat on his thighs.
But once or twice, even in the pain, a flash of
splendor went through him—at her arched lathered
neck, the lift of power from beneath, some
new magic from the earth—</p>

<p>No need to ask the way to Mort Cotton’s place.
Mamie veered to the left, at the end of San
Forenso’s main street, following the wagon tracks
at a show-trot to the wide gateway, where she
was welcomed from all quarters at once. Mort
Cotton called his greeting from the doorway of
the ranch house, as Elbert let himself down,
steadying himself before letting go of the pommel.
Mort approached. What was left of the
younger man withered as those eyes, under the
white bushy brows, fixed upon the mare. This
was far more severe than being appraised himself.</p>

<p>‘Lucky old Bob couldn’t see her, with the saddle
as far back as that,’ Mr. Cotton remarked.</p>

<p>Elbert had ceased to breathe. Raw and angry
patches wavered in imagination before his eyes,
as the saddle was being removed. Hide and hair
unruffled—a flood of thankfulness went through
him. He moved around to Mamie’s far side and
all looked intact there, too. Mort’s twisted hand
was now knuckling down the buttons of the
mare’s spine.</p>

<p>‘Thought so, all the weight on her kidneys.
Say—’ The old man’s glance had turned to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>Elbert really for the first time, the sharp eyes
settling upon his riding cords. ‘Caked, or I’m a
Spaniard! I see you’ve been punished, too. Come
on into the house. The boys will take care of
Mamie. They know her.’</p>

<p>Elbert obeyed, but made no move to a chair
as they entered the cool front room.</p>

<p>‘I led her down part of the way,’ he confessed
unsteadily. ‘But she wanted to get here. She’s
so much—all the time—’</p>

<p>‘She sure is—so much hoss all the time. I
know her. And what you want now, young man,
isn’t to hurry away nowhere too sudden, but
quarters to cool down in right here, good upstandin’
quarters. And say, I’ve got some hosses
for you to do your rough ridin’ on. Mamie’s a bit
too fine to break a man in. I’m goin’ to give you
some lessons personal, before you leave, and bring
you up, so’s you’ll know what you’re ridin’, when
you get Mamie under the saddle—’</p>

<p>‘Not at once,’ said Elbert.</p>

<p>‘No, you’ll be walkin’ like a bear for a week
yet.’</p>

THE SOFT SIDE OF A SADDLE</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Elbert</span> limped out to Mort Cotton’s stables
next morning. Mamie saw him coming, her head
hanging out above the half-door. She began
nodding in a way that made him know she was
pawing the ground, though he couldn’t see her
feet. It wasn’t hay she wanted. Was it word of
the one who did not come, or more of the Road,
she was asking for? Elbert wouldn’t have confided
to any one the humility he felt, as he moved
close. All through a painful night, he had dreamed
of the mare running from him, fighting his approach
and presence. She would stand up on her
hind legs and strike at him when he came near.
Ugly lot of sleep torments, in which Mamie was
always getting hurt—his fault—but nothing
to them after all. Here she was fresh and blithe
as usual, nudging, nosing, ready as a child to begin
all over again. A fine lift went through him,
that she didn’t hold a grudge.</p>

<p>He had to rub his eyes after a moment ...
Mexico, riding South, plazas at night, camps in
the open, days in the saddle, the freedom he had
dreamed of.</p>

<p>... In the next ten days all business was finished
in San Forenso and Elbert was healed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>enough to begin his course in horsemanship under
Mort Cotton—the actual riding part. So far as
words went, the drill had begun at once.</p>

<p>‘What you need is hardenin’, young feller, and
that comes gradual. You’ve been sittin’ on cushions
all your life and a stock-saddle ain’t like
that. The soft side of a stock-saddle is placed
next to a horse. You got to learn to fit to it, because
it’s made not to give. After that, you’ve
got to learn to ride easy. It ain’t like sittin’ on a
box in a grocery store. You can always tell a man
with no sense to a horse, sitting up and takin’ it
for granted, that a horse is meant to carry him.
A man’s weight’s got to be alive—part of his
horse—not a dead weight like a pack-mule carries.
Bob Leadley used to say a good deal at the
last that there’s plenty of good “riders” but only
one in a hundred real horsemen.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve heard him say that,’ said Elbert. Times
like this, he wished Mort Cotton wouldn’t stop.
The old cattleman was altogether unlike Mr.
Leadley, but the two had been so much together,
that a feeling of closeness to Bart’s father came
to him as he talked and rode with Mort. There
was much still he needed to know about the old
days.</p>

<p>‘... I wasted a lot of time hatin’ Letchie Welton,’
Mort Cotton once said. ‘But there’s no
good in that. Old Bob found that out, too. You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>wouldn’t fancy him a fightin’ man, but I saw him
flare up. Letchie Welton can thank me that he
lived for Lon Bimlock to kill him. It was at the
hearin’ back in Bismo, and Letchie was tellin’ our
fellow townsmen that he had a suspicion right at
the beginning that Bart was in with the other
three in the murder of old Batten. That, he said,
was why he insisted on Bart bein’ allowed to ride
on with the posse—so he could watch him. As
it happened Bart got away. No question in his
mind, Letchie Welton gave down at the hearin’,
but that Bart had killed Palto to prevent him
squealin’, before ridin’ out to connect up with his
share of the loot. “Didn’t he want to stay up all
night in order to let Palto go free?” Letchie
wanted to know.... As I say, I had my work
cut out to keep old Bob from killin’ our deputy
sheriff that day.</p>

<p>‘... No, sir, we weren’t exactly right—never
have been, Bob and me, since that night in Red
Ante,’ Mr. Cotton observed, another time. ‘They
talk of shell-shock these days. It wasn’t shells
that got us, but we were shocked men just the
same. It worked this way: We never could stay
long where men were—never could get along in
the settlements any length of time. We took up
prospectin’ to get up into the mountains alone,
but we couldn’t be too close, even to each other,
for very long. I’ve seen Bob go apart to smoke of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>an evenin’, after we’d worked separate ridges all
day, and I’ve felt the same way. It was quite a
while before we came to know we were so different.
I began to see it in Bob, and gradually it
worked out that he could see it in me.</p>

<p>‘I wouldn’t have believed it of Bismo, and Bob
couldn’t, but that town wasn’t wrought up over
what happened in Red Ante, like we were. Seems
as if Bob and me took the full shock of that,
though we were slower catchin’ on, than young
Bart was. Palto’s bein’ a Mexican seemed to
make it all right for Bismo. A greaser had murdered
a white man and a whole Mexican village
of men, women and children couldn’t pay for
that.... Always a man of law, Letchie Welton
was. Bismo called him a trail-burner for bringin’
in his man, and made him sheriff afterward. He
held his job until three or four years back when
he was shot from his horse, as I told you, on the
trail of Lon Bimlock. They say Letchie was
sleepin’ his last sleep before he touched ground
that day, havin’ taken Lon’s forty-five between
the eyes.’</p>

<p>There was a lot of inexpressible feeling in
Elbert’s chest as he listened to certain observations
of Mr. Cotton on the relationship between
Bob Leadley and his son. It made him draw a
step nearer that mystery of mysteries, his own
father. ‘Bob was a strong man with men before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>Bart came,’ Mort once said. ‘Then gradually on
that one point they came to think of him as the
favorite fool of the diggin’s. Some said he was too
easy, some said he was too hard, but all said he
was wrong.</p>

<p>‘... But I was tellin’ you about the last days
in Bismo. You see Bart couldn’t come back if he
had wanted to. It got worse against him as weeks
passed and Marguerin wasn’t brought in. Rueda
was caught and hung, his last words bein’ that
Marguerin had done the killing. Word reached
Bismo that Marguerin and Bart were together in
Mexico, ridin’ with Monte Vallejo, who was just
a bandit-leader down in Sonora in those days, but
high up in Sonora politics right now—apt to be
the big gun if the Government turns over. Also
we’ve heard various times that Bart is still ridin’
with Monte Vallejo—that’s one of the things
Bob must have wanted you to know.</p>

<p>‘Bob was down in Mexico five years back and
might have come up with Bart, except as he tells
it, all at once the rurales began to take an interest
in his case. They couldn’t do enough to help him
find what he was after. You see the rurales are a
strong body of men, workin’ sort of alone-like,
mainly on the side of the Government, and hell-bent
after all bandits, when they feel like it—’</p>

<p>‘How did the rurales find out what Mr. Leadley
was down there for?’ Elbert asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>‘Now as to that, my mind’s at rest. Letchie
wasn’t done for at that time. He tipped ’em off,
as I see it—always a man of law, Letchie was.
And, of course, the rurales would be interested
in a white man down there, lookin’ for his son
who was said to be ridin’ with Monte Vallejo,
for the rurales have been tryin’ to get their hands
on Vallejo for years, but you see the common
people like the big bandit, and are not so strong
for the rurales, who lord it over ’em and feel important,
havin’ the law on their side.</p>

<p>‘Old Bob always kept track of Monte on Bart’s
account. He used to bring me translations from
the Mexican papers, how Monte had burned this,
and beaten his way through that, and how the
rurales had just missed capturin’ him. If I was
you, I wouldn’t try to cross the Border straight
down from here. Ride east for three or four days,
takin’ your time and make your crossing at
Nogales. You’ll be able to get in there, more
quiet and unwatched, and you’re more apt to be
closer to the scene of operations of the man
you’re lookin’ for. It won’t be long before you’ll
be hearin’ of Monte Vallejo’s doings. He’s ’specially
active right now. If Bart’s still with him—that’s
another thing. Anyway take it easy, an’
take your time—’</p>

<p>‘I know that road south of Tucson to Nogales—worked
at Heaslep’s drivin’ a truck,’ said Elbert,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
‘I might stop off for a day or two to see a
couple of friends of mine—’</p>

<p>‘So long as you don’t tell anybody what you’re
out on,’ warned Mr. Cotton. ‘I’m sure Bob
would have advised you this way—if he’d had
time.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll be careful about that,’ Elbert said, and
yet his pulse pricked up at the thought of another
sight of Cal and Slim.</p>

HEASLEP’S AGAIN</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">He</span> was actually on the Road, traveling east
toward Tucson, Mamie showing up from hour to
hour a little better than he could ask or expect.
Elbert had to keep telling himself that there was
no hurry, no stress, but the urges of all past years
rose up in him, trying to make him believe that
everything was ahead, instead of here and now.</p>

<p>Expense money to work with, a gold mine back
of him; best of all, there was a purpose to carry
out; a meaning back of his setting forth. Had he
tried to plan it all before leaving the East, he
couldn’t have arranged an adventure half so satisfactory
as this—not just an aimless ride, no
mere purposeless freedom. By some marvelous
destiny he had come into the right to venture
forth—a quest to work toward, an allegiance to
make good with Mr. Leadley and his son, with
silence on his tongue all the way.</p>

<p>No, he was not to tell any one—not even Cal
and Slim, if they were still at Heaslep’s.</p>

<p>He reached the main buildings of the big ranch
shortly after noon, five leisurely days of riding
from San Forenso. Approaching the ‘Office,’
faces looked out from cook-house, farrier shop,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>and other doors and windows. Elbert waved and
nodded, but there was no flare of welcome, no
adequate answer for him—all eyes fixed on what
he rode. He had to wait a minute for Frost-face,
who appeared from his back room, nodding curtly.
He moved at once to the outer door, where his
sleety gaze fixed on Mamie at the far end of the
rail.</p>

<p>‘Your’n?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘In the advertisin’ business?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘Been workin’ in a movie?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘Show horse?’</p>

<p>‘No—’</p>

<p>‘Want a job?’</p>

<p>‘No. Just thought I’d stop off—possibly see
Cal and Slim—and some of the boys.’</p>

<p>‘Thought you’d come back to locate. Here’s
a letter an’ telegram. Thoroughbred?’</p>

<p>‘Her father was.’</p>

<p>Frost-face moved out to Mamie. The telegram
was from Mort Cotton, advising him to wait at
Heaslep’s for a letter containing a certain newspaper
clipping. The letter already at hand, was
the one referred to in the telegram, for Elbert
drew out a half-page of a Sunday newspaper and
a moment later was deep in the latest Sonora
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>doings. Frost-face’s jerky tones cut in presently:</p>

<p>‘Cal and Slim are out in the northeast range—about
fifteen miles. They’ll be ridin’ farther
north to-morrow, but you can get to ’em by sundown.
Better drive the truck out, though.’</p>

<p>‘The mare isn’t tired,’ said Elbert.</p>

<p>‘Her thorough-breedin’ might wilt down.’</p>

<p>‘She can do fifteen—’</p>

<p>‘Be careful not to let any of the cow-truck out
there bite her.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll watch close.’</p>

<p>‘Stop off here for a package of paper napkins
and readin’ matter to take out to the range—before
you start.’</p>

<p>All that afternoon as he rode, Elbert conned
the alleged facts of the newspaper story. Monte
Vallejo was said to be greatly enlarging the number
of his followers, turning away hundreds of
peons because they had no horses. This Monte
was certainly a cavalry leader first and last,
Elbert reflected.... American holdings threatened;
gold and silver mines and oil properties
of Northern Sonora, unsafe; General Cordano
reported to be establishing garrisons near the
big mines in an attempt to forestall seizure,
but none could tell when Monte Vallejo would
strike—</p>

<p>Elbert reached the distant camp at sundown,
but full darkness had fallen, before the final thud
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>of ponies on the range grass, and Slim’s voice
called from outside the circle of firelight.</p>

<p>‘... if it ain’t Elber-r-rt!’</p>

<p>And big Cal rocked forward, taking him by
both shoulders at once—one of those moments
when Elbert wouldn’t have dared to use his voice.</p>

<p>‘What’s this I hear about a she race horse
you’re ridin’?’ Slim asked.</p>

<p>Elbert pointed out toward his picket pin, and
the two moved toward it. Mamie was led in
toward the fire, and examined in all points, her
owner being entirely overlooked for the time being.</p>

<p>‘Where did you say you come from?’ Slim
asked severely.</p>

<p>‘San Forenso.’</p>

<p>‘Any more like that there?’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t see any.’</p>

<p>‘Somebody leavin’ the country?’</p>

<p>‘She was given to me.’</p>

<p>‘Was he dyin’?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>Cal and Slim glanced at each other.</p>

<p>‘Elbert,’ said Slim. ‘You didn’t hurry him off
none?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘You see, it <i>has</i> been done,’ said Cal. ‘For a
hoss like that, it has been done. I recollect hearin’
that old Chester was fought for in his gay young
days. Ever hear about that, Slim?’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>
<p>The other nodded solemnly.</p>

<p>‘Ain’t back to stay, Elbert?’</p>

<p>‘No—’</p>

<p>‘Where you goin’?’</p>

<p>The partner’s eyes checked off each other
again, and finally Cal remarked: ‘Looks as if
Elbert might need help—’</p>

<p>‘He’s makin’ me restless,’ said Slim.</p>

<p>After supper, the three sat down at a small fire
a little apart from the main camp. Elbert was
watching himself closely, some tension not to be
lured into disclosure of any kind. One fact rested
lightly on his faculties at this time. The more
that men knew about horses, the more Mamie
was appreciated. Cal and Slim had opened a
newspaper package and divided a big Sunday
paper between them.</p>

<p>‘Please excuse us, Elbert, while we cool down
our passions for news,’ said Cal.</p>

<p>A poring silence of many minutes; then from
Slim: ‘This fellow’s crazy.’</p>

<p>‘How’s that?’</p>

<p>‘The fellow writin’ this—either crazy, or else
there’s goin’ to be a war less than a hundred miles
from here!’</p>

<p>‘Who’s fightin’, Slim?’</p>

<p>‘Mexican war—over some oil wells—down
San Pasquali way—’</p>

<p>‘Any white men?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>‘Sure. That’s why. This fellow Burton—“Mexicali”
Burton—he’s American. Struck it
rich in oil, but looks to be unpopulyar with a revolutionist,
called Vallejo—’</p>

<p>‘Just a Sunday newspaper yarn,’ said Cal.</p>

<p>‘This feller who’s writin’ says Mister Vallejo
could use them oil wells of Burton’s to pay off his
soldiers and finally take over the government.’</p>

<p>Elbert wasn’t breathing right. Another version
of the same newspaper story Mort Cotton
had sent. He felt as if the truth was being extracted
in spite of him; that Cal and Slim had
somehow landed into the midst of his private
business. Perhaps he shouldn’t have come. At
the same time, he was powerfully thrilled by
some vague prospect, his mind repeating to itself
that he had given nothing away so far.</p>

<p>Slim, meanwhile, was reading aloud laboriously
about an American oil man, named Burton, who
had sent in a call for help to General Juan Cordano,
in charge of the Government soldiers in
Sonora. This man Burton was said to be standing
pat on his property at San Pasquali with a few
dozen white men and some Mexican laborers he
wasn’t at all sure of.</p>

<p>‘Every time them newspaper fellers up in Tucson
can’t think of anything else to write on, they
start a Mexican revolution,’ Cal said.</p>

<p>‘But why couldn’t it be?’ asked Slim, sitting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>up straighter, more and more sleepless, his bridle-arm
lifted, his right fallen limp as if he were in
the saddle. Slim had to wear his belt tight or it
would drop down over his hips. One had a feeling
that it could be pulled up over his shoulders without
loosening a notch. ‘Why couldn’t it be?’ he
wanted to know in a louder tone.</p>

<p>‘You’re breaking in on my rest,’ Cal murmured.</p>

<p>Slim straightened out his legs and helped himself
to his feet with both hands. Taking a quart
cup from his mess-case, he went back to the cook-wagon
and returned with it full of hot coffee.
‘This ain’t no night for rest; this ain’t no place
for me, Cal. I’ve been making forty dollars a
month so long, anybody’d think I was keepin’ up
a twenty-year endowment policy—’</p>

<p>The big one bent over to Elbert, whispering: ‘I
shore hoped he was over them spells. Six months
since Slim’s been took like this. Sad, ain’t it?’</p>

<p>But Elbert saw a reddish flare in Cal’s eyes,
usually so icy gray and cool. Something queer
was taking place in himself at the same time, a
wild hope—the last chance on earth. But he
couldn’t miss that he was forgotten now, the pair
more and more involved in each other as the tension
grew.</p>

<p>‘You’ll admit we’re dyin’ off here,’ said Slim.</p>

<p>‘Not so loud; hush yourself,’ said Cal. ‘We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>ain’t got no grudge against Heaslep’s. We don’t
want to start a stampede of hands just as round-up’s
comin’ on.’</p>

<p>‘That’s so,’ Slim muttered.</p>

<p>Elbert suddenly found the eyes of both men
boring into his. ‘You won’t tell ’em anything
about this, will you? We ain’t got nothin’ against
old Frost-face,’ said Slim.</p>

<p>‘I shore would hate to see this outfit left short-handed
through any abrupt transformations
takin’ place between me and Slim,’ added Cal.</p>

<p>‘I won’t say anything,’ Elbert declared, but
the sound of his own voice was strange and unsteady.
A moment later he strolled off into the
dark. He didn’t trust his face or his feelings
which to himself, at least, were conveying meanings
louder than words. In a moment or two,
Cal’s easy tones reached him.</p>

<p>‘Elbert!’</p>

<p>He went back.</p>

<p>‘Anything eatin’ you?’</p>

<p>‘No—’</p>

<p>‘You ain’t figurin’—’</p>

<p>‘No, I won’t tell Frost-face, or any of the fellows—’</p>

<p>Cal chuckled: ‘It ain’t that. Slim and me sort
of forgot ourselves. Bein’ married a long time,
it works that way. Can’t be you’re honin’ to
perforate the Border like Slim?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>‘Wouldn’t I slow you up?’</p>

<p>‘We thought of that, but concluded we could
do with a balancer—’</p>

<p>‘I think it would be fine—’</p>

<p>‘It’ll be a blow to Frost-face, if we do break
out. Speak Mexican?’</p>

<p>‘I’ve been studying it lately a little. I had
some Latin which helps—’</p>

<p>‘Lord, does Latin run in your family, Elbert?’</p>

<p>‘I speak Mexican,’ Slim reminded, in the tone
of one wronged.</p>

<p>Cal squinted at the fire. ‘Sure, I forgot. Slim
eats her.’</p>

<p>Elbert looked up at the stars. They had suddenly
blazed out friendly, and over the cattle
came a warm wind and folded him in.</p>

<p>‘Excuse me,’ Cal added. ‘I’ve got some very
close work to do right now—threadin’ a needle
to tack my war-sack together.’</p>

old Chester, Slim on his ‘Indian’ and Elbert
astride.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Elbert,’ said Cal that first afternoon in
Mexico, ‘she’s shore an indulgence for the eyes.’</p>

<p>A few minutes before sundown they entered
the small pueblo of Cienaga. Six hours in the
saddle; Elbert was tired, athirst; the early May
sunlight had been burning, but except for the
occasional oppressive doubt as to his power to
carry on without his two friends finding out his
real mission, and the fear that his tenderfoot ways
might slow up their adventuring, Elbert was possessed
by an extraordinary elation; as if part of
his lungs that had never known air before, had
quietly opened, alive at last.</p>

<p>The moment of fastening the horses at the
hitching-rack in the sleepy sandy street, before
the little cantina in Cienaga, was memorable
from all others in life. There was a dust cloud in
the low dobe doorway. Such was the stillness and
deep ease in the air, that each grain of dust hung
in enticing suspense, a meaning and purpose Elbert
was sure of, and needn’t try to think out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>‘Tequila,’ said Slim, as they entered the
shadows.</p>

<p>‘Same here,’ said Cal.</p>

<p>It was like the hold of a ship in a way; the
smell of dried orange-peel; a range of barrels with
Spanish writing on them, a breath of coolness;
shelves of canned and bottled goods, wines and
catsup and pickles resting together in dusty composure.</p>

<p>‘I will, too,’ Elbert said.</p>

<p>The little fat man of the place had been trimming
his oil lamp, pouring in coal oil from a large
glass jar. He drew out a second piece of glassware
from under the counter, slightly smaller,
but of similar shape to the first. The contents of
the two jars were of identical color.</p>

<p>‘Here goes,’ said Slim, and the three small
glasses were raised.</p>

<p>For a second Elbert thought he had been shot
in the neck. Out of the pandemonium of his
faculties then formed the suspicion that either
they burned tequila in the lamps, or else that was
the Mexican name for kerosene.</p>

<p>‘The first one always hits me where I ain’t
lookin’,’ Cal remarked. ‘Suppose we go through
the formalities of three more.’</p>

<p>Elbert braced to do it again. He felt himself
standing very straight, only there was a curious
illusion that his spine extended clear through to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>the top of his head. The reverberations of the
second shot having died away, Elbert was conscious
of a faint aroma, as if all the dried fruits
and tubers and woodwork had blent in enticing
fragrance. A horse nickered from afar down the
street and their three ponies at the hitching-rail
raised their heads—Mamie’s instant answer being
ramified by Chester’s dignified head-tones,
and a shrill broken pipe from the ‘Indian.’ A
kind of union and interplay in all things—glint
of drift and daring in Cal Monroid’s eyes. The
little fat man was shaking his match box. It
really wouldn’t do for the lamp to be lighted just
yet. Elbert spoke up:</p>

<p>‘We might risk one more,’ he said with slow
care.</p>

<p>Now Cal and Slim took his invitation in a
queer way. They pawed each other and kept
saying: ‘I told you so.’ Could they mean they
weren’t regretting they had let him come?</p>

<p>‘I like it here,’ said Slim.</p>

<p>‘I feel like stayin’,’ said Cal. ‘I could eat some
of these here dried herrin’ and pickles standin’
up, but I suggests we saunter to a table somewhere
and feed on somethin’ firm. I could stay
all night—’</p>

<p>Elbert, standing very straight, turned away to
the doorway that last moment before the lamp
was lighted, and there he beheld his Crimson
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>Foam—the whole West over the horses’ heads,
shot with Indian red. It was worth the beginning
at Heaslep’s, the struggle with Fortitude, the
leather-store and even the years of Eastern schooling.
Only he mustn’t fall to telling how joyous
he was. Meanwhile Slim and the little fat man
were having words. The former turned to Cal
with his wronged look:</p>

<p>‘What you goin’ to do with a fellow like this?
He keeps hornin’ in with English. Says I called
him a horse. Says I mean caballero, not caballo.
Wants to know if we’ll have our chickens boiled
or fried.’</p>

<p>‘Quickest for me,’ said Cal. ‘Only tell him I
ain’t broke off with beans.’</p>

<p>After supper, Cal suggested that they go out to
the corral to see if the horses were making out as
well as they were. Elbert sat back against a stone.
The straw smelled dry and clean; the sky was
close and velvety; the three horses were grinding
sun-parched corn, a soothing sound; everything
expansive and exactly right, only a persistent tendency
to be reminiscent, which Elbert checked.
Finally at his right, a chuckle from Cal:</p>

<p>‘Slim—’</p>

<p>‘Yep?’</p>

<p>‘For a tenderfoot, I’m sayin’ our young friend
Elbert holds his fire-water aloft some successful,
don’t you think?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>Slim allowed that, and Elbert’s face turned
away to the dark, so his exultation might not be
seen. He felt on the eve of a mysterious graduation
ceremony....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Toward mid-afternoon two days later they entered
the pueblo of Nacimiento, and two thin
dogs skulked across the road ahead of their horses.
An old man, beyond human speech, was sitting
in the sun against a wall, and a little farther on,
another. That seemed the end of life, as they
paused before a fonda marked ‘El Cajon.’ The
sandy road at this point was beaten with many
pony tracks.</p>

<p>‘Looks as if a troop of cavalry had halted here,’
Slim said in a hushed tone.</p>

<p>A moment of rich promise to Elbert, except
that he wished he didn’t feel so played out. They
entered the deserted wine-room. Slim drew a finger
over the bar-board and left his mark in the
dust. A scared lame boy finally came out from
the shadows behind. No mistake about his gestures;
they were urged to move on.</p>

<p>‘What do you think we’re up against?’ Cal
inquired. ‘Yellow fever or just war?’</p>

<p>‘Can’t say,’ said Slim, ‘only far from home—far
from home.’</p>

<p>‘We might keep on going to Burton’s oil wells
at San Pasquali. Can’t be more than eighteen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>miles from here, but it would take the edge off
the horses; also what little nape of Elbert’s, as
ain’t wore off already.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I’m all right,’ Elbert hastened to say,
‘whatever you think best.’</p>

<p>At the end of town they heard a phonograph,
the twisty piping tones of ‘El Chocolo.’ In a
doorway presently appeared a barefooted old
woman with a broom in one hand and a pair of
castanets in the other. Slim uncorked his Spanish.
It sounded to Elbert as if he were asking for
rooms with bath. The Señora’s mouth opened,
but no sound came. She raised one foot and
clucked the castanets, finally coördinating:</p>

<p>‘No sabe, Señor.’</p>

<p>Slim repeated.</p>

<p>The other foot vanished; the castanets vibrated
and a single word shot forth: ‘Baños,’ was the
nature of it, the Señora pointing to a tin wash-tub
under the eaves. At this point Elbert had to
attend to Mamie, who wasn’t taking to the Señora
and her castanets. Her feet were planted firmly
against advance to the hitching-rack, and a long,
tremulous wheeze poured out of her nostrils, signifying
distrust, alarm.</p>

<p>‘I’ll love up the Señora,’ said Slim, confidently.
He dismounted and bowed low. The Mexican
woman couldn’t resist and turned into the doorway,
bidding them follow. Mamie now relaxed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>and Elbert was the last to enter a flowered patio,
where the Señora brought pans of water for them
to wash, and then began stirring in the ashes of
the ancient fireplace.</p>

<p>‘I’m takin’ on hope,’ Cal breathed. ‘She’s
fixin’ to boil something, if it’s only grool.’</p>

<p>‘Frijoles,’ lightly called Slim. ‘Also, huevos,
Señora, also tortillas tom bien.’</p>

<p>Her back was toward them, her face still bent
over the fireplace, but her hand shot up, registering
the orders on the castanets.</p>

<p>At this instant something began to be wrong
in the air. A far-off sound took the heart out of
Elbert; hatefully familiar, it was, spoiling at once
all the mysterious warnings of deserted Nacimiento—the
chug-chug of an earth-eater, high-powered,
and coming fast.</p>

<p>A small, square, vined window in the patio
faced the road. Elbert moved to it, Cal and Slim
following. The three heads looked out, a hush
fallen upon them. A cherry-colored sedan, dust
of Mexico unable to cover its incredible modernity,
halted before the Señora’s door, and three
queer boyish figures hopped out.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 id="X">X<br><br>
‘WATER IS FOR HORSES’</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent">‘<span class="smcap">They’re</span> white,’ whispered Slim. ‘They’re play-actors.’</p>

<p>Then from Cal: ‘What kind of little boys would
you say them were, Elbert?’</p>

<p>‘I wouldn’t. They’re girls in hikin’ clothes.
Don’t you see their vanities?’</p>

<p>‘Short hair and short pants, Elbert—where
do you look for them points you speak of—oh,
you mean them little satchels?’</p>

<p>Mexico had petered out; hope dead.</p>

<p>‘You go in first, Elbert. I never coped with
nothin’ like them,’ Cal murmured.</p>

<p>They followed the Señora into the front room.
A chunky, black-haired girl, who had sat in the
driver’s seat of the sedan, was letting it be known
that she and her two friends had stopped for
refreshments, on their way to San Pasquali. Her
voice was resonant, and she tried to make volume
do, being without Spanish.</p>

<p>The Señora held up her empty hand; her mouth
opened, no sound. Slim hurried back to the fireplace
to fetch her clappers.</p>

<p>The black-haired one stamped her foot. She
was used to getting what she wanted. ‘Oh, can’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>you see, we’re hungry, thirsty—something to
eat and drink?’</p>

<p>She had muscle, and big blue eyes.</p>

<p>‘Put your hand on your belt. Miss,’ Cal called.
‘Make signs of bein’ caved in.’</p>

<p>‘Hush up, Cal. That ain’t no language to use,’
said Slim, stepping up from the side. ‘Allow me
to interperate for you, lady.’</p>

<p>‘Thanks, if you please.’</p>

<p>At this point Elbert’s hand touched a hand at
his left. He turned and said ‘Excuse me,’ in severe
tones. A swift shy smile met his eyes—the
face of one unmistakably frightened, but handling
it—a girl who could cry engagingly, but
only after everything was over. Her tones had a
curious way of not disturbing the stillness.</p>

<p>‘I think we made a mistake in coming—an
awful mistake,’ she laughed. ‘I told Florabel we
ought to turn round and go back, but she wouldn’t
hear to it—’</p>

<p>Elbert turned to Florabel whose blue eyes were
flashing up to Cal’s. ‘I’m Miss Burton, and I’m
going to San Pasquali to surprise Papa!’</p>

<p>‘Won’t you, though!’ enthused Cal.</p>

<p>The third of the girls was smaller, younger—a
whitish, wide-eyed face, hovering above a large
and high-colored necktie. Slim had taken over this
little one, but she was slow to soothe, her eyes
getting wider, the white of her skin fading into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>colorless fear. Meanwhile, in shy tones, Elbert
was hearing the story of their coming from the
girl at his left.</p>

<p>‘We’re from Miss Van Whipple’s Finishing
School in Tucson. It’s spring vacation now, and
we were sight-seeing in Nogales this morning,
when Florabel got the idea to rush down here
and see her father. It was only seventy miles,
she said, and wouldn’t take more than three
hours, and then we’d be safe. I’m afraid we’ve
made a terrible mistake—’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid you have,’ said Elbert. He was
used to a houseful of sisters and he carried no
heartstrings whatsoever for passing winds to flap.</p>

<p>Her name was Mary Gertling. Her short hair
was neither black nor blonde, but there was a roll
to it, down over her temples, that Elbert remembered
as a sort of aim of all his sisters’ girl friends
before he left. He forgot what Mary was saying
for a minute, studying the creamy light through
her skin. It made him remember the thin bowl of
alabaster on the ceiling of the dining-room at
home. She didn’t seem to mind his severe ways.
She just couldn’t seem to believe it of him. He
recalled the ominous signs which attended their
riding into Nacimiento, the many pony tracks.</p>

<p>‘If I were you, I’d ask Miss Burton to turn
around now and go back,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘But Florabel never would. She never turns
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>back—in anything. She says her father is less
than twenty miles from here.’</p>

<p>She talked up to him so trustingly. The little
fawnskin coat covering her shoulders had that
texture which draws the hand to touch. Her ways
were swift and still; but Elbert had lost his revolution
and his heart held hard as flint.</p>

<p>‘Come on, Mary!’ called Miss Florabel.</p>

<p>The three girls followed the Señora into the
patio. Elbert stood in deep thought a moment,
before he realized that Cal and Slim had closed
in upon him.</p>

<p>‘Our little Elbert ain’t no hosstipath,’ said
Slim. ‘I’ve seen smoother hands all around with
hosses, but for women and motor trucks he’s
faster than a coiled whip—’</p>

<p>‘Faster than the human eye,’ said Cal.</p>

<p>‘They belong to the Van Whipple Finishin’
School up in Tucson,’ Elbert said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>‘So we draws.’</p>

<p>‘It’s vacation. They were sight-seeing in Nogales.
They ought to be sent back—’</p>

<p>‘We heard you tell her!’</p>

<p>‘It’s all this Burton girl’s fault.’</p>

<p>‘Slim,’ said Cal, unheeding, ‘you and me ain’t
got no sway with this finishin’ school, if Elbert
ain’t.’</p>

<p>‘We’ve got to have some sway,’ said Slim, ‘or
it’s goin’ to be the plumb finish.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>‘What do you think our duty is?’ Elbert asked
absently.</p>

<p>‘Our duty, I’d say, by these finishers,’ Slim
whispered with considerable weight, ‘our duty is
to stay with ’em whether they like it or not, and
I’m meanin’ to do just that, only—’ He pointed
to an empty place in the room where the littlest
of the girls had stood, ‘Only, every time I takes a
step to her, this little one with the rainbow necktie
and the ruffle on her uniform, she looks as if
she’s goin’ to stagnate down an’ die. I shore expects
a bleat out of her, my next step, and all the
time I see Elbert out of the corner of my eye,
gettin’ closer and closer and talkin’ lower and
faster—’</p>

<p>‘Must be some perfume he has on,’ said Cal.</p>

<p>‘I didn’t take it she was particular afraid of my
advance,’ modified Slim, ‘just generally hos-tile.
I sure drew the outlaw, though.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps,’ suggested Cal, ‘if we turn over little
Rainbow to Elbert, we could manage the other
two.’</p>

<p>‘That is as nature fixes it, Cal. We’d have
some trouble right now, tearin’ that little Mary
female away from Elbert, the inroads he’s made.
But no use standin’ here. I’m goin’ to get a pair
of knives and whetstone out of my war bags an’
freshen up for supper.’</p>

<p>‘You’re not meanin’ to shave, Slim?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>‘That’s the presumption.’</p>

<p>Elbert rustled hay from the shed and carried
it out to the hitching-rack, the Señora’s house being
suspiciously short-handed. Half way between
the corral and the kitchen door, he sat down, and
moodily watched the Señora getting supper. She
did her work on the run, back and forth in the old
stone kitchen, castanets off. Her bare feet seemed
to roll up under her as she sped, one at a time
reappearing to give the stone floor a shove. It
was like a double-action paddlewheel. Curious
sizzlings reached his ears from the open fire, also
fascinating scents. He was sure sliced onions
were curling and browning on the pan.</p>

<p>Supper was set for six. Elbert found Mary
Gertling seated at his left. He rose from the table
to get a glass of water, but the Señora prevented,
thrusting red wine in his hands.</p>

<p>‘Vino tinto! Vino tinto!’ she exclaimed.</p>

<p>‘I’m s’prised, Elbert,’ Slim corrected. ‘Didn’t
you know water is for the horses?’</p>

<p>‘Isn’t everything wonderful?’ whispered Mary
Gertling.</p>

<p>‘Do you think so?’ Elbert inquired.</p>

<p>‘Dulzura!’ flamed Slim; then Cal’s easy voice
as he monopolized the attention of Florabel Burton:
‘So your father hasn’t written to you none,
Miss, that there’s a mixture of politics going on
about his oil wells?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, yes. Papa always allows for that. He
says it wouldn’t be Mexico—if there wasn’t
some trouble in the air.’</p>

<p>‘No special trouble lately—things comin’ to
a head?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, let’s go back!’ trembled the voice from
behind the big necktie.</p>

<p>‘Just take it easy, lady,’ in Slim’s gentlest corral
tones.</p>

<p>‘Things are always coming to a head down
here,’ said Miss Burton.</p>

<p>‘I know,’ said Cal, ‘I can understand just how
you feel. But we’re concerned, especially Elbert
here. If you knew that boy as well as I do, you’d
seen by his face that he’s sick with concern right
now.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Florabel!’ said Mary Gertling. ‘Can’t we
ask them to go with us? I’ll breathe so much
easier.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, let’s!’ faintly from the little one, whom
they called Imogen.</p>

<p>‘Why, we’ll be down there in an hour, before
it’s really dark!’ Florabel objected, but finally
gave way.</p>

GAS AND GUNS</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Elbert</span> smelled gas, as he rode behind the sedan.
It had always been so; gas belonged to the deep
fatigue of his bones. One of the keenest minutes
he had ever lived was that in which they had
leaned down toward the wide tangle of tracks in
front of the fonda marked El Cajon—all able-bodied
men gone from Nacimiento, and big doings
promised farther on. And then, a matter of
mere minutes afterward, his old enemy had come
roaring down the dirt road. Girls&mdash;everything
spoiled&mdash;Cal and Slim all changed around.</p>

<p>The sedan was just rolling forward, but it kept
the ponies at a lope. It seemed hours; the sliver
of a moon had sunk out of the sky. Florabel’s
resonant voice reached him from the car. No
secret now why ‘Mexicali’ Burton dared to stand
off Northern Sonora for his oil wells—the father
of this girl would be like that. Cal loomed in the
dark, having waited for Mamie to come up.</p>

<p>‘Your lady-friend’s got her mind made up to
sit a horse for a ways, Elbert. Slim’s Indian ain’t
that kind of a horse, and your Mamie’s a filly
yet. I figure she’d better try old Chester, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>you sort of ride close and keep him consoled and
her camped in the right place.’</p>

<p>‘How about you, Cal?’</p>

<p>‘Nothin’ else will do, but I’m to test my morals
in the little red buggie.’</p>

<p>The transfer was made. Elbert rode on through
the thick May dark with Mary Gertling at his
left.</p>

<p>‘I’ve been on a horse before,’ she said.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid you think I’m being a trouble.’</p>

<p>Still Elbert’s lips were locked. He couldn’t see
her clearly, but her hands certainly were not in
sight. Nobody with any sense of a horse would
leave her hands in her lap.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I’m afraid you don’t like to have me
here!’ reached him in the stillness.</p>

<p>‘Sure. Pick up your reins. We’re falling
back—’</p>

<p>‘But he bumps so—’</p>

<p>‘They don’t make horses any smoother than
he is. Want to get back in the car?’</p>

<p>‘No-o.’</p>

<p>‘You’re doing all right.’ He had lied in spite of
himself, and this didn’t make him feel any better.
Old Chester, tired as he was, couldn’t be expected
to keep his feet trim, with no hand of authority
communicating with the bit. Heat increased under
Elbert’s collar. A heave in the road and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>left hand shot out before he thought. It was
clutched. Warm, small, firm. The two horses
pulled apart a little, but the hand didn’t let
go. He was afraid of yanking her out of the
saddle.</p>

<p>‘I’m so sorry to make you cross. I think it was
awful for Florabel to think of coming—oh—I’m
falling!’</p>

<p>The hand slid out of his. He hurriedly dismounted.
Mary was hanging sideways, both
hands on the pommel. Elbert knew the abused
look of Chester’s head, hanging low in the dark.
He pushed her back up in the saddle.</p>

<p>‘Need any help?’ Slim sang back from in front.</p>

<p>‘No!’</p>

<p>‘Why, Elbert, I never heard such tones as
them, spoke from you before—’</p>

<p>‘Oh, please don’t be cross!’ in a whisper from
his side. ‘I don’t know what I’d ever have
done—’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s all right.’ The miles were the longest
in his experience. During the last twenty minutes
the horses had trudged up hill, the motor
making noisy business of the grade. Then the
ridge and lights below, San Pasquali, doubtless.
Elbert fancied he smelled the oil wells. He would
never get away from gasoline.</p>

<p>‘Hadn’t you better get into the car?’ he remarked
to Mary Gertling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>Cal was back on old Chester. The sedan had
just started down-grade, when Elbert saw three
red perforations in the dark ahead. The fraction
of a second later, three separate concussions
shocked his ears—not gas explosions, guns!
There was one scream—from the little one—and
Cal’s yell directed toward the car, as he
spurred forward. ‘Better turn back, Miss—they
may have the town surrounded!’</p>

<p>Slim’s Indian and Mamie had settled down
after Chester. Shouts of Mexicans sounded beyond
the car, just as Elbert’s mare came to abrupt
stop. The sedan had halted, too, but the lights
still pointed straight ahead. Florabel wasn’t making
the turn; she was either shocked helpless, or
her engine stalled. In the wide fling of the head-lights,
Elbert saw armed Mexicans standing across
the road. Then they started this way—six or
seven figures running toward them, hands upraised,
rifles held aloft For once Cal’s voice lost
its drawl.</p>

<p>‘Get in the car, Kid! Let your horse go!’</p>

<p>Elbert’s leg lifted out of the stirrup—one of
the hardest things he was ever called to do, but
that very second the lights of the sedan went out.
There was one clear call from Mary Gertling,
deadened by a blasting roar from the sedan’s
exhaust at the very knees of his mount. Too
much for Mamie. She went straight up and tried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>to keep going, Elbert at the very top, arms around
her frantic throat at the narrowest—as the darkened
sedan gouged forward like a speed-boat.
Cal’s voice reached him:</p>

<p>‘... that Burton girl—she’s shootin’ the
lines! Come on, Slim, it means us, too! Come on,
Kid!’</p>

<p>Shots in the air—shots from ahead and at the
sides.</p>

<p>He felt Mamie tottering still on her hind feet;
then a jerk as if some one had given her a cut
with a whip, and over she went backward. He
pushed her neck from him and fell back, and knew
no more, until Cal’s low tones, as he was being
lifted.</p>

<p>‘It’s all right. Kid. Chester’s good for both of
us.’</p>

<p>For a time, in spite of that, he thought he still
had Mamie round the neck, but it was Cal’s
ample chest—Slim’s Indian in an easy gallop
alongside.</p>

<p>‘Where’s the sedan?’ he finally mumbled.</p>

<p>‘Lord, Kid, she’s surprised papa by this time!’</p>

FLASHLIGHT AND FAWNSKIN</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Elbert</span> kept shaking his head; no bones broken
there or elsewhere, but seemingly no end to the
phases of his coming-to. It dawned on him there
had been a blank from the time Mamie went over
backwards, until he found himself here on Chester
with Cal. He regretted missing some part in
there—going through the Mexican lines.</p>

<p>‘Where’s Mamie?’ he demanded, jerking erect.</p>

<p>‘Came through all right. Slim’s got her safe.’</p>

<p>Now Elbert gradually made out that they were
in ‘Mexicali’ Burton’s oil town. They had been
halted—first a voice in Mexican, then American,
Cal answering quietly. He saw the sedan, and
heard from aside in the dark, Mamie’s long-drawn
wheeze, the same protest as when she had
refused advance to the hitching-rail before the
Señora’s house in Nacimiento. There was one
cabin door from which light streamed, and in the
aperture a blocky, bareheaded man appeared,
legs planted wide apart, the air suddenly burned
by withering profanities.</p>

<p>‘... bringin’ three young women through Vallejo’s
lines!... Sap-heads, you fellows. It’s running
out of your ears!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>‘I’m not takin’ no free talk from no oil man,’
growled Slim.</p>

<p>Cal mildly broke in. ‘Now as to that, Mister—’</p>

<p>‘Can’t you see we’ve got a war on?’ the blocky
one in the doorway yelled. ‘Can’t you see they’re
twenty to one, tryin’ to get our oil wells?’ His
face had turned sidewise; light fell upon the uncovered,
close-cropped head—massive jaw, thin
lips and startlingly familiar blue eyes. Around
that roaring neck from behind, a pair of white
arms were flung at this instant, ‘Mexicali’s’ fury
shut off:</p>

<p>‘But Papa! I keep telling you it was all my
fault!’</p>

<p>Florabel had the floor, but another figure had
moved into the light behind her. ‘You see, Mr.
Burton, when we three wouldn’t turn back, they
rode along with us, to protect us.’ That was
Mary Gertling. So they had all reached the cabin.</p>

<p>Elbert still felt confused. Slim’s voice broke in
now, stern with dignity. ‘Seein’ as there’s no
further need for us to be engaged in protectin’—otherwise
we might ride on—’</p>

<p>Another rip. ‘... ride on what? Ride on
where? Don’t you see we’re surrounded?’</p>

<p>‘Papa!’</p>

<p>‘Mexicali’ slowed down to bellow orders to his
men, both Mexicans and Americans hurrying in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>and out. He rang bells in both languages. Meanwhile
Cal and Slim had entered the lamp-lit quarters,
and Elbert followed, meeting the eyes of
Mary Gertling. Still those eyes hadn’t broken
into tears; still that inexplicable stillness around
her—the same faint trace of a smile, as in the
first moment in Nacimiento.</p>

<p>Now ‘Mexicali’ Burton and Cal Monroid were
facing each other, like two chiefs—one instantaneous
look. All they had seemed to need was
this one look in the lamplight. Each knew a man.
It was a moment of romantic fulfillment to Elbert.
His mind had suddenly renewed its grasp on the
fact that Bart Leadley might be a part of Vallejo’s
lines now closing about; yet at the same time
he could not miss the way the fighting face of
‘Mexicali’ Burton had suddenly softened and
turned in appeal to Cal.</p>

<p>‘It was bad enough before,’ he was saying,
slowly. ‘Vallejo’s got numbers. I trust my white
men, but you never can trust the Mexicans. Cordano
himself may double-cross me. Can’t tell
when he’ll get some troops here. It was bad
enough before, but what can a man do with three
girls—?’</p>

<p>A whimsical smile was on Cal’s lips, which
formed to answer, but the words were never
spoken.</p>

<p>That was the instant the gods of North America
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>undertook to get a flash-light photograph of the
lower end—stupefying flash and crash—blinding
glare, heaving darkness, falling timbers, the
scream of one horse.</p>

<p>Elbert was on his knees, eyes and nostrils
choked with dust. He thought of Mamie outside;
then certain new business and nothing else occupied
his brain. In that unbelievable glare, he had
seen the face of Mary Gertling. The light hadn’t
shone upon her face, it had flowed into it, through
it. He had seen the secret of her stillness, and
though he couldn’t recall the nature of it now,
he was perfectly aware that an explosion like
that might breed another and he must somehow
get to her, before it happened again.</p>

<p>He was calling. She called back just once. He
was groping for her now. His hand touched objects,
but they had nothing to do with what he
groped for. His ears were filled with voices, but
he was really listening only for one. His fingers
touched the little fawnskin jacket, and beneath
his face as he knelt, there was the queerest low
sob; one arm came up and held him, and the
words:</p>

<p>‘You shouldn’t have been quite so long—’</p>

<p>At his side was the distracting rattle of a match
box, the strike of the stick. A face appeared—‘Mexicali’
Burton—all below the eyes, a gleaming
black of blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>‘Florabel!’</p>

<p>‘Papa!’</p>

<p>‘You and the other two—get into the sedan—before
they explode the second powder house.
One of my own natives probably. Get into—get
into the sedan—’ subdued, sincere, not an
extra syllable. Father and daughter—they had
found each other. Cal and Slim had found each
other. Elbert bent. ‘I didn’t mean to be so
long—’ he said.</p>

<p>The one arm tightened around him. Another
match was struck. Florabel screamed at the sight
of her father’s face. ‘Mexicali’ drew the hollow
of his sleeve down over it. ‘Shut up, Flo’,’ he
said in the same subdued way. ‘Just a scratch.
Pile into the sedan—’</p>

<p>‘I can’t move.’</p>

<p>‘You must—who’s this lyin’ across your
lap?’</p>

<p>‘That’s Imogen. She’s fainted. She did it
before.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll put her into the sedan. Come on—’</p>

<p>‘I can’t—’</p>

<p>‘I’ll lift you in.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t drive—’ The sentences shot back and
forth; even Cal Monroid spoke: ‘Speakin’ of
drivin’—that’s the Kid’s job—’ all while the
second match burned.</p>

<p>‘Sure, Elbert’ll drive,’ from Slim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>Elbert bent again. ‘We’ve got to go to the
sedan.’</p>

<p>‘Yes—’ from under his lips, but she did not stir.</p>

<p>‘Come on. Won’t you help me?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes—’</p>

<p>‘Can you walk?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Come then—they’re putting Imogen in.’</p>

<p>‘But you—’</p>

<p>‘I’m going with you—’</p>

<p>‘Oh!’</p>

<p>He felt the queer uncertainty of her body, as
she gained her feet, yet she seemed trying to help
him. Yes, she had promised to help; her one
hand was actually trying to lift him, at the same
time holding on.</p>

<p>Florabel and Imogen were in the back of the
car. He couldn’t see if they were rightly in the
seats. Elbert took the wheel, and drew Mary
Gertling in after him. Her hand didn’t feel right.
Another hand was now thrust in through the door
after Mary was seated—‘Mexicali’s’—wet,
hot, hairy.</p>

<p>‘You’ve got to get there, young fellow!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Clear through to Nogales.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll vouch for Elbert,’ came from Cal, who
seemed standing just behind Burton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>‘But how about Mamie?’</p>

<p>‘Slim and me’ll take care of her.’</p>

<p>‘I ain’t gone over her, but she’s on her feet.’
This last was from Slim. ‘We’ll keep her for you.’</p>

<p>‘You can’t take the road you came by—not
for a ways.’ ‘Mexicali’ went on, thickly. ‘Keep
goin’ toward the derricks. Follow the wheel-tracks;
they’ll work you back to the main road
later. Use your lamps—when you have to—’</p>

<p>‘Papa—’</p>

<p>‘Don’t bother me!’ The voice was thick, as if
‘Mexicali’s’ throat was filling with blood. ‘We’re
stayin’ here, but these oil wells aren’t a hell of a
lot, compared to the baggage you’re carryin’,
young fellow. Clear through to Nogales, do you
hear?’</p>

<p>‘He’ll get through, Mister,’ said Cal, and then
the same voice trailed, ‘So long, Kid.’</p>

VALLEJO’S LINES</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Elbert’s</span> mind didn’t steady down at once to the
wheel. A moaning kept up from behind. That
was Imogen. Part of him, too, seemed listening
for Florabel’s voice; he had vaguely counted on
her undertaking to drive from the back seat, as
his sisters used to, but not a word.... Gasoline....
Girls.... ‘Thirty years late.’... Tequila—coal-oil—vino
tinto.... ‘Water is for horses.’...
Mamie.... Thus his mind kept churning, as
if to get a certain harrowing review out of the
way, before he took up the matter at hand. Certainly
matters at hand—the wheel, the girl at
his side. He expected her hand to rise out of the
dark and tangle him further, but it didn’t come.
Queer to have her on his right. She had been on
his left always before.</p>

<p>He was following the wheel-tracks among the
derricks, using his lights when he had to. Perhaps
he was getting close to the second powder
house; anyway, he was doing what he was told....
He wasn’t exactly right; he had to stop to
think that he wasn’t back in old Fortitude’s stiff-backed
seat. A deep hurt about leaving Mamie
behind and not being exactly true to his secret
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>quest, preyed upon him; also the possibility that
Bart Leadley was within a mile of him at this
moment, working with Vallejo to get Burton’s
oil. A voice shouted from ahead—Mexican—part
of Vallejo’s cordon. Now Bart or not, he had
to get down to business. He had baggage. He
had to get through.</p>

<p>All was black before his eyes. He was holding
the sedan to a mental picture of the dirt road,
impressed upon his memory an instant ago when
he turned on the lights, but the black scaffoldings
of the derricks wove crazily before his eyes; the
chance of a smash taking his breath. He felt the
wheel jerk as it left the tire-grooves. A row of
rifle flashes showed ahead; glass splintered around
them.</p>

<p>‘Get down—way down,’ he gasped.</p>

<p>He pressed the throttle, holding the wheel
toward the guns; the engine roared underfoot.
The firing was from behind now, but he kept
going into the blackness until he couldn’t risk
another second; the sense of leaping off into an
abyss of darkness was so keen.</p>

<p>Lights showed the wheel-tracks; still the derricks
on either hand. Not a sound or a touch from
his side. More rifles cracked ahead. It had to be
done again.</p>

<p>‘Get down, way down!’ he called. Again the
car shot forward through the flashes. This time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>hands touched the outside; bumps of metal, more
splintered glass. The wheel jerked out of his
hand; the sedan ditched, but didn’t overturn. In
a flash of one rifle, he saw a second figure—mouth
open, pistol raised. He seemed to look
right into that open mouth and belching muzzle.
The fenders on the same side screeched against
stone.</p>

<p>He wasn’t right. He had to throw his body forward
on the wheel to hold it, as he turned on the
lights—only the right hand working. He was
back in the wheel-tracks, but the car kept fighting
away from him—a flat tire. He felt an absurd
need to explain. ‘It was that left front tire
that threw me—’ but she wasn’t listening. His
foot sank upon the throttle.</p>

<p>Now Elbert was badly mixed about that left
front tire and his own left side—both flat. He
had to hurry now while his right arm lasted. ‘I’ll
vouch for Elbert.... He’ll get through, Mister....
So long, Kid.’ But all the time he was getting
farther and farther from Mamie—from
Bart!</p>

<p>The wheel-tracks had circled back to the main
road. His right foot steadied down. He had to
hold the wheel with all his strength to make up
for the retard on the left.... Not a touch or a
sound from his side. Thirst was stealing into him
like the cold. Maybe she was thirsty.... Maybe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>they wouldn’t know which was which—tequila,
coal oil.... ‘I’ve been on a horse before....
He bumps so.’... ‘Thirty years late.’... He
had lights; he held to the highway, his foot
pressed to the floor.... She wasn’t helping—not
a touch, or did she mean to help by keeping
still?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Vaguely Elbert heard low words like this:</p>

<p>‘He doesn’t relax. He keeps listening for a
voice. The rest of the time he seems to think he’s
driving something—a horse or a car. It’s not
always clear. If he could only stop driving himself,
every time he comes to, and get some rest’—a
strange woman’s voice.</p>

<p>‘Put him to sleep again,’ a man replied from
the far side of the room. ‘I’ll answer his father’s
telegram, but nobody could satisfy these newspaper
men, and have time for anything else.’</p>

<p>Of course, they didn’t understand. He had to
get through. He had to keep on, while his right
arm lasted—clear through to Nogales. And
even if he did, it wouldn’t mean that he was
making good to what he set out for. He had
passed up the main chance, falling for another....
There was a pricking in his right arm now,
but no sound from that side, not a word—everything
muffled and getting farther away ... until
Cal’s easy tones really began to set him straight:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>‘Take it easy, Kid. You got ’em here—right
here in Nogales! You brought ’em through—days
ago. Listen, Kid, you don’t need to drive
no more!’ That voice always straightened things
out.</p>

<p>‘But Mamie—’ he finally broke out.</p>

<p>‘She’s waitin’ for you. We brought her up—fine—’</p>

<p>Elbert felt himself moving softly after that,
into an altogether different zone of sleep. ‘But
where?’ He locked his lips. He mustn’t ask anything
more.</p>

<p>Cal came again, and finally with Slim, but it was
a dreary time before they let him ask questions.
Mamie was right here in Nogales. ‘Mexicali’
Burton’s party had held out until morning at San
Pasquali, when General Cordano had come, driving
Vallejo away.</p>

<p>‘Did he lose any men?’ Elbert mumbled.</p>

<p>‘Who?’</p>

<p>‘Vall—I mean Cordano—or Mr. Burton?’</p>

<p>‘Some,’ said Slim, suspicious of delirium again.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>... Another time, and they were telling him
everything but what he wanted especially to
know. Yes, Mexicali with a crushed jaw had
kept on his pins all through that night of the
explosion, until relief came. ‘He’s here in Nogales
right now—jaw in a sling,’ added Cal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>Elbert craftily inquired about Florabel.</p>

<p>‘She got broke somewhere—I didn’t hear
where,’ said Slim.</p>

<p>‘Not so she ain’t goin’ to recover,’ finished Cal.</p>

<p>Elbert’s lips forced him to say, ‘And little
Rainbow?’</p>

<p>‘Not a scratch,’ said Slim. ‘She just fainted
and wasn’t there to get hurt—when that explosure
took place.’</p>

<p>Elbert was silent. Cal’s voice took up the story:
‘As for that little Mary-woman, I’m holdin’ a
letter for you she left before her parents took her
up to Tucson.’</p>

<p>It was like splintered glass, the way Slim broke
in: ‘We’d better go, Cal. Elbert ain’t lookin’ as
well as he should.’</p>

<p>Cal arose: ‘She got all right before she left, except
for one broken arm.’</p>

<p>Several seconds ticked, before the question:
‘Which arm?’</p>

<p>‘Now it was the left arm, as I recall.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I see, she couldn’t—’ Elbert halted with
a jerk. It seemed they never would go.</p>

A LETTER</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">They</span> had put out the lights. Even the night-light
at the far end of the hall was turned low, but
sentences wrote themselves out on the ceiling; a
pause, then a sentence; a pause, then another.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<i>... Could it have been the wine she gave us at
supper—the barefooted old woman? I was so very
thirsty!... I can’t understand. I can’t believe,
yet I distinctly remember insisting that I ride that
horse.... I was so horribly frightened—except
when I was near you.... I couldn’t help seeing
how the others turned to you.... Won’t you please
believe I never acted like that before?... It was
because you were so firm—that I could breathe
better where you were.... And in the car—it was
like hanging on a cross, wasn’t it?... Oh, won’t
you get word to me that you forgive?</i>’</p>
</div>

<p>Such a stillness around each sentence.</p>

<h2 id="XV">XV<br><br>
TUCSON</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">He</span> was sitting up when Cal and Slim came again.
That was the day of the telegram that his father
was leaving the East and would be in Tucson in
three days more. Also there were more Tucson
and Border papers with a lot extra to say about
Vallejo’s attack on the San Pasquali oil wells; of
the rescue of the American party by Mexican
government troops; but especially of the motor
drive of one white man through the rebel’s lines—seventy
miles north, clear through to Nogales—how
the car had been found at dawn at the
edge of town, the driver close to death from a gunshot
wound in his left side, two American girls
unconscious in the car, and another unhurt, but
too scared to talk.</p>

<p>‘Not a drop of gas in the tank or you’d have
rammed right into the Border, Elbert,’ Cal said.</p>

<p>‘You sure stepped on the oats,’ said Slim.</p>

<p>‘We didn’t get to stay in Mexico,’ Elbert complained
after a time. ‘We had to come right
back.’</p>

<p>Cal and Slim looked at each other, faces long
and grave.</p>

<p>‘He didn’t get to stay,’ said Cal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>‘Only one horse went over back with him,’
said Slim. ‘Only one powder magazine blew up.
Only hit by one forty-five—’</p>

<p>‘Had to come right back,’ said Cal.</p>

<p>‘I thought I’d get to ride,’ said Elbert, ‘but I
had to drive that car—’</p>

<p>Cal inquired after a moment: ‘Do you reckon
we might take Elbert along again sometime?’</p>

<p>‘I ain’t a well man. I ain’t ready to state as to
that right now’,’ said Slim. ‘I need to be babied
along at Heaslep’s, where they ain’t rough, and
talk gentle—’</p>

<p>‘He wants to hear about old hoof-and-mouth,’
Cal suggested.</p>

<p>‘They’re going to let me out of here to-morrow,’
said Elbert. ‘I’ll be goin’ up to Tucson—to
meet my father.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Elbert was clear of the hospital before he began
to see things straight. In fact, he was standing
with Mamie in her box stall the next day in the
livery stable at Nogales, on the American side,
when some perfectly useless frictions and pressures
fell away. In the first place, here was Mamie
safe and sound, and the future opened with a new
chance to begin over again at the bottom. Had
he lost the mare, there could have been no real
beginning over, at the bottom or anywhere else.
Secondly, he hadn’t divulged his secret, even in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>delirium. Certain time had been lost, the fault
his in deciding to stop at Heaslep’s for a friendly
call on the way from San Forenso to the Border.</p>

<p>Beyond doubt he must travel alone from now
on. He was breathing easier. A bit weak on his
legs—too long in bed—but ready to begin
again. Queer, how it all cleared up for him standing
with Mamie like this. ‘Stand around and
talk to her,’ Bob Leadley had said. ‘She likes to
be consulted on family affairs. It won’t do you
no harm. She’s one more listening mare.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll just leave you right here, Mamie,’ he
whispered, ‘while I go up to Tucson for a day or
two. These people seem to be treating you right—and
it’s handy to the Border. Take it easy
till I come back, because we’ll be losing ourselves
in work after that.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>... A queer, embarrassed half-embrace, neither
knowing just what to do or say, and a swift look
into his father’s eyes after several months—really
the first exchange that had the beginnings
of understanding in it. Elbert finally grasped
what a son is so slow to find out—that his father
was not merely a parent, but a separate human
being, with his own struggles, silences, dilemmas,
like the rest of the world. It was Elbert’s first
understanding of his own house, and the man
of it, from the attitude of an outsider. Another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>moment of a fresh beginning in life, he realized.
Meanwhile sentences like this were passing:</p>

<p>‘Got yourself pretty badly shot up?’</p>

<p>‘It was a bad jumble for a minute—’</p>

<p>‘But you saw them through—’</p>

<p>‘I had to. I don’t even remember, most of
it.’</p>

<p>‘Come on, let’s go in to dinner.... No, Nancy
isn’t married yet, but the house feels as if news
might break out any day—likely by the time I—we—get
back—’</p>

<p>The last was nothing like a foregone conclusion,
but phrased tentatively, with questioning
look.</p>

<p>‘No, I won’t be going back just yet,’ Elbert
said.</p>

<p>He felt the silence; also suddenly he felt his
father’s side as well as his own. A man accustomed
to a houseful of daughters might really
want to have his only son standing beside him
very much. It was an entirely new angle.</p>

<p>‘Haven’t got enough?’</p>

<p>‘Not quite through—’</p>

<p>‘Going back to Heaslep’s?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no—’</p>

<p>No resistance from his father. Elbert hardly
knew how to handle this new man-to-man acquiescence—no
tampering. He had braced himself,
but no strength was required; and now for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>moment he was unnerved by friendliness. Was
his father changed, because of things the newspapers
said about his drive to Nogales? A whole
lot of stuff had been written which no fellow could
pay any attention to, about himself. Elbert began
to feel an almost irresistible impulse to tell
the whole story to his father.</p>

<p>‘Not going back to San Pasquali?’ the latter
asked.</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘I was hoping you didn’t mean to tie up with
this man, Burton—’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no.’</p>

<p>‘And those friends of yours—those cowhands—’</p>

<p>‘I’m planning to be alone for a while.’</p>

<p>Elbert’s answers were automatic. A fight was
still on in him, not to divulge about Bob Leadley
and the gold mine. It seemed almost that his
father had the right to know—but Elbert kept
his mouth shut.</p>

<p>Toward the end of dinner the elder man said
with a laugh: ‘You’ll be needing some money—’</p>

<p>‘No, I’m all fixed, thanks.’</p>

<p>Elbert couldn’t follow his father’s reaction to
that. Mr. Sartwell said nothing, but seemed both
glad and sorry at the same time. After that he
spoke with even a little more care, not to impose
his will. It was like two men talking in a club,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>about anything in the world, except what each
meant to the other.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Elbert was waiting in the reception room of the
Finishing School. It was the summer season and
only a few of the girls were staying over—those
whose families did not live in Tucson, possibly.
The place was shaded and flowery; blossoms on
all the tables, and one great basket, shaped like
a French hat of an old day, on the piano, filled
with young pink roses. He heard laughter and
whispering in the hallway. It wasn’t exactly clear
to him what he must say or do. He felt his wound
right now, a sort of general breakdown. The door
he was looking toward—the direction the voices
came from—didn’t open. Her step sounded from
behind. He saw her first among the vines at the
window, facing the porch. Her lips moved, her
hand lifted, the door opened, but everything was
stiller than one could imagine.</p>

<p>‘I would have known you—’</p>

<p>‘Of course—’</p>

<p>‘It’s probably because I saw you before—I
mean before dark that night—’</p>

<p>He felt a vague surprise in himself that he
caught the drift so readily. ‘At the barefooted
woman’s—’ he finished.</p>

<p>‘Yes—’</p>

<p>‘It was different, after supper that night,’ she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>went on, ‘but I’m glad I would have known you,
as you are to-day. Reading the papers was so
confusing.’</p>

<p>‘They never know when to stop.’</p>

<p>‘They didn’t tell it nearly all, either—’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I wouldn’t have known it was the same
story by reading it in the papers.’</p>

<p>‘I see—’</p>

<p>She was changed—less glitter somehow, as if
her light came from deeper in, a light more delicate.
She had on a creamy dress, no folds in it,
but not tight anywhere. This meeting wasn’t
like the first time in the Señora’s house; nor yet,
was it like the sense of her which had come in the
hospital, from so many hours of pondering over
the separate sentences of her letter. Suddenly he
knew he must never tie himself to any particular
moment when with her, because she wasn’t going
to be the same the next time. Tying to one meeting
would keep him from catching on to all that
the next held in store. His mind clung for a
moment, however, to the memory of the alabaster
bowl at home, while she was still going on
about the newspapers.</p>

<p>‘They didn’t see you. They didn’t know what
we did—what we tried to do. They sort of
laughed at us, and talked of your great bravery,
but there was something no one saw—’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>She was standing at his left—a hush between
the sentences. ‘... They didn’t know that somebody
was helping us—’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘I mean it wasn’t just your strength. Why,
you were like one dead; and yet you still drove.
It was only when we were safe that your hand
relaxed—’</p>

<p>‘A case of knowing I had to, wasn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘More than that. That helped, of course, but
there was something more—’</p>

<p>He said: ‘I didn’t know much of what was
happening at the time—that is, to remember,
but I had a feeling you were helping—’</p>

<p>‘Did you know that?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Really, did you know that?’</p>

<p>‘I had the feeling you were helping,’ he repeated.
‘First I thought your hand—you know,
I thought your hand would come up and help—’</p>

<p>‘It couldn’t.’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t know then.’</p>

<p>‘It was because it couldn’t, don’t you see?’</p>

<p>‘No. I don’t understand.’</p>

<p>‘When I found I couldn’t lift my hand, I knew
I had to help another way!’</p>

<p>‘You mean you—you prayed?’</p>

<p>‘I never did before,’ she laughed. ‘Yes, it was
like that—’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>It was as if the windows were all thrust open
into a wide silent summer, like the stillness of
mountains, where there is not even the rustle of a
wing. A clean perfume came in, and there was a
clear seeing in Elbert’s brain, as if an arc-light were
burning, where only candles had shone before.</p>

<p>‘It was so dreadful, because I had promised,’
she said.</p>

<p>‘How was that?’</p>

<p>‘You had asked me to help you, and I had
promised. Then I found I could not even lift my
hand. It was then I kept saying, “I have to help
him, please. I have to help him, please—”’</p>

<p>‘I see,’ said Elbert.</p>

<p>‘And then it was as if I could see the car below—see
right through into it, and I could see you
and me, sort of little and broken inside, and I
could feel <i>our</i> pain, but we were really together
outside and above, and we knew it would be all
right—’</p>

<p>Now he could actually help carry out her picture.
‘I remember in the hospital,’ he said
quickly, ‘when they gave me an anæsthetic, I
could look down at myself like that. I wouldn’t
tell anybody—if I were you.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I wouldn’t for worlds! They’d call it being
out of the head!’</p>

<p>So she had kept all this, until he came. Just
now he turned to her, and there wasn’t a sound
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>from the halls. The light was easy and flowing
in the room. Everything was like a slow movement.
His right foot raised to take the step toward
her, but suddenly he knew if he took the
step, it would be next to impossible to remember
clearly that he must find Bart Leadley; quite
plain, it was, that if he took this step toward her,
he wouldn’t be able to go down into Mexico alone
and keep his mind to the allegiance he had entered
with Bart’s father. His foot settled back
to the floor.</p>

<p>‘... And the later part—all different—I’ll
never forget!’ she was telling him. ‘It was when
the dawn came—the time we were in the awful
cold—and they found us, and you were hanging
forward on the wheel—your face was like stone—eyes
open, but no life. Oh, I’ll never forget!
It was as if the skin of your face were pulled back
over the bones from behind ... and they lifted
me out to an ambulance, before they lifted you,
and I saw your left side—all wet and stained
dark ... and then I knew I wasn’t helping—so
frightened from your look—and I knew I must
not fall into fears, nor pay any attention to your
wound, but help more—from higher up, and
never stop—’</p>

<p>It was getting harder and harder to think of the
work ahead. Elbert plunged into the inevitability
of it right now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>‘I’ve got a work to do,’ he said. ‘I’ve got to
go away. I’m glad I came to-day. About all this—I
won’t forget any of it. I’ll know more about
it—when I come back—’</p>

<p>The most astonishing thing of all, she seemed
to understand even that—no resistance whatever
from her, as there had been none from his
father. Was it always like this—when one was
sure of himself?</p>

<p>‘I have work to do, too,’ she told him at the
window. ‘We’ll know all about everything, when
the time comes.’</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Weeks</span> afterward in old Mexico. He hadn’t
moved straight down toward Nacimiento and
San Pasquali, where Monte Vallejo was last
heard of, but had followed the Border west, leaving
the main highway, sinking himself into the
country. He was taking it easy, learning the language
from the voices in the daytime and his
Spanish book at night. Days of learning—getting
to know the feel of the people, learning
Mamie, and that was not all—learning himself.
No more leather-store; he wasn’t dreaming. An
old fear that something was wrong about him,
even anatomically wrong, in relation to a saddle,
had pretty well died out. Sometimes he even
fancied that Mamie answered his rein, as if it
were old man Leadley’s velvety touch.</p>

</div>

<p>That song was like an ever-continued story.
A woman’s voice with guitar, this time, and the
old wistfulness came over Elbert—the same that
he had felt in the Plaza of Los Angeles. Here he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>was in a little native plaza—far from travel-lines,
not even sure of the name of the town, yet
he had to stop and think that all he had wanted
so restlessly a while back, had come to pass. At
least, he was working out the old dream day by
day, Sonora at her sleepiest and dustiest now,
days interminably long and changelessly hot.</p>

<p>Though the fierce daylight had faded out the
shine from her bright bay coat, Mamie was hardening
to the road, and the man was coming to
know some of her movements and whims, if not
all. Gradually Elbert perceived also that she was
aware of many of his. He never tethered her at
night, yet she never strayed. He hadn’t been
able to learn the lip-and-finger call, the way Bob
Leadley had shown him, but there was a whistle
in the handle of the sheath-knife he carried, and
a blast from that brought the mare in from the
sweetest herbage.</p>

<p>He liked the nights in the open, Mamie grinding
at her forage the last thing—drowsiest sound
in the world to him. And her early call; out of the
deepest sleep he would hear that. But by the
time his eyes were open, the mare was merely to
be seen feeding at a distance, her head turned
away. If he dozed again, a more peremptory
summons would sound, but Mamie was apparently
calling to the hazy hills, her farthest concern
to do with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>One morning he didn’t doze a second time, but
covertly watched. About ten minutes after first
call, the mare stopped feeding and came toward
him, her hind feet lifting high and quickly, like a
race horse, under the big blanket. Suddenly she
stopped, blatted her loudest toward Elbert’s
partly covered head, but wheeled on the instant
and was cropping again.... Fearless and winsome,
a walk-trot mare, ready to go, ready to
keep on, invariably increasing the pace as his
hand idled at the reins, or his thoughts roamed
away. Often Elbert would come to himself finding
Mamie in a full ten-mile trot, when he had
not been paying attention for several minutes.
The pace seemed to steal upon her, and would
end in a run if he did not bring her down.</p>

<p>One day it occurred to him that she never
dropped into a walk from a trot, or back into a
trot from a gallop, unless pulled up. There was
no exception that he could remember. But the
black night at San Pasquali had left a double-died
complex at the core of Mamie’s emotional
self. The sound of a motor car made her unreasonable
at once. She would have been glad to
do the day’s work over again any night, to get
away from a town where machines had penetrated.
Her one other deranging influence was an
oil derrick. One of these attenuated triangles
spoiled her whole horizon, like a finger of doom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>Gradually his rides took him farther south and
west. Plenty to hear of Monte Vallejo, the bandit,
of whom the peons of some districts were
passionately fond. But never a word of a possible
white man who rode with him. It would be
a matter of luck, Elbert often thought, that
would bring him up with Bart, if that ever happened.
What he needed now, more than knowledge
of Spanish, or anything else, and he came
to know this very well, was sheer patience to
carry on. It wasn’t possible to ask questions
about Monte Vallejo, without the people becoming
suspicious at once. They thought he was
somehow interested in helping the rurales, who
did much of the hard work in keeping the districts
in order, and yet were disliked as a matter of
course by the people. Elbert often wondered
what he could ever do single-handed, when the
rurales for years had failed to bring in the bandit.
Also General Cordano, who commanded the military
of the whole country-side, was Vallejo’s
sworn enemy for political reasons, and yet with
all his soldiers had been unable to put a stop to
the activity of the bandit.</p>

<p>Everywhere it was related that the notorious
Monte had the best horses in Sonora. Elbert was
in a way to hear much of this, because the people
seemed inevitably reminded of the point by his
own coming to their different towns. It wasn’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>himself who attracted the people, however, nor
held their eyes. It was Mamie whom they gathered
to see, looking her over, even bringing lanterns
in the evening, ever drawing near and saying
to each other:</p>

<p>‘Monte Vallejo would like that mare,’ or,
‘Monte Vallejo rides a horse like that.’</p>

<p>Many weeks passed before his task became
actual. He had been as far as a hundred and
fifty miles southwest, and had made a big circle
north again toward the Border, when word sped
from town to town that Monte Vallejo had held
up a westbound Yuma Pacific train in the San
Isidro Gorge, not primarily to loot the passengers—that
was incidental—but to relieve two
express coaches of a string of thoroughbreds en-route
to the running meeting at Tia Juana.</p>

<p>At this very time, Elbert was in the little town
of San Isidro, less than twenty miles from the
scene of the hold-up.</p>

<p>Southwest with his new saddle-stock, the master
of the road and his band were said to be galloping
with three troops of rurales beating the
trail behind—the latter stung and aroused as
never before. Gold bar couldn’t have challenged
the mounted police like this theft of bang-tails.</p>

<p>Elbert got it all as straight as he could in his
mind that night, and the next morning before
full light, he filled his saddle-bags with what provisions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
he could procure in San Isidro and rode
out, following the trail which a northern squad
of rurales had taken after the bandit. He tried
not to appear in too much of a hurry, but Mamie
unquestionably felt the force of this fresh clue
and the excitement in the air. Sonora was really
wrought up. The entire body of rurales had taken
the road to make a sure job of it this time.
Meanwhile the people kept it a secret where the
bandit’s picket lines were stretched, and fixed
their faces for a great laugh at the expense of the
mounted police.</p>

<p>But the hour had evidently arrived for an
astonishing turn of affairs. The second day out
from San Isidro, Elbert became aware of a persistent
rumor to the effect that Monte Vallejo
was having trouble covering ground with his new
string of horses. They were sprint-bred, but few
of them took to steady distance work, so important
in the present flight. On the third day, the
most incredible of all announcements shocked
Sonora—that Monte Vallejo and seven of his
men had been captured a few miles beyond Arecibo;
that they had been brought back to that
town, and were being held there under a guard of
rurales, as well as watched over by the little garrison
of Cordano’s soldiers located at that point.</p>

<p>No trial; only an order from General Cordano
was awaited, it was said. Upon the receipt of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>this, Monte and his seven, without reservation,
would be put to death in el cuartel at Arecibo.
‘A mere formality,’ the natives moaned, intimating
that supplying the paper would be a pleasant
task for General Cordano. This ‘mere formality’
sunk into Elbert’s head. Later the news reached
him that another wing of Monte’s band had been
taken. The rurales were having their turn of luck
at last.</p>

THE ART OF DYING WELL</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Arecibo</span> was thirty-five miles away, when Elbert
received this news. He did fifteen miles more that
day, and the next mid-afternoon when he was
close to the town where Monte Vallejo was said
to be held, a most inviting level stretch of turf
showed ahead. Mamie did not miss the fact.
She had been well rested in San Isidro; her fitness
brought to a fine point, which two full days’
work had not dulled. She was teasing at the
man’s arm, at this very moment, and rising under
him, as a small boat in open sailing after the drag
of a breakwater. She took the gallop and Elbert
wasn’t so hard to persuade, as she stretched out,
loosening her mouth from the restraint of his
hand.</p>

<p>There was a laugh on his lips, as he let her go.
These were some of their best moments together,
and this particular dash promised to be a jewel
among them—only in the lee of a big boulder as
he flicked round a bend, stood one of the rurales
at ‘raise pistol,’ and a snapping bark to halt from
his throat.</p>

<p>It took nearly a hundred yards for Mamie to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>slow down. Elbert turning her about at length,
perceived the native trooper riding his way—one
of Sonora’s finest—gunned, spurred, saber-sheathed
on one side, carbine-booted on the other,
a heavy cartridge-belt flung over left shoulder
and under right arm. Around the mustacios was
a restless, uncertain look.</p>

<p>‘Magnificent horse you ride, Señor.’</p>

<p>‘She’s a good mare—just trying her out.’</p>

<p>‘Had her long?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes—’ but that didn’t seem to go with
‘just trying her out.’</p>

<p>The rurale was sizable for a Mexican; not so
tall, but thick in proportion; heavy wrists, bulging
forearms, thick, straight back. His pony
looked small and desperate compared to Mamie,
but kept going with outstretched head.</p>

<p>‘And where does the Señor travel?’</p>

<p>‘The next town—Arecibo.’</p>

<p>‘I also go to Arecibo.’</p>

<p>Mamie was now being regarded with even
more than customary interest, back and forth,
up and down, the rurale’s eye roving, so that it
was with difficulty that he kept his mind upon
conversation at this time. Still Elbert was used
to this sort of thing, having frequently found
himself judged as a caballero of some great and
elaborate house by the horse he rode.</p>

<p>‘I have heard that the notorious Vallejo is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>being held in Arecibo,’ he began with sociable
impulse.</p>

<p>‘Yes?’ questioned the trooper in return.</p>

<p>Elbert wondered at the curious tone. This
man had reservations.</p>

<p>‘I have been on the road for two days and possibly
am misinformed,’ Elbert added carefully.</p>

<p>‘On the road—from where, Señor?’</p>

<p>‘From San Isidro—’</p>

<p>The other’s hand jerked at his bridle-rein.</p>

<p>Now Elbert began to realize that San Isidro
was hardly a town to mention—so close to the
gorge of the same name where the recent hold-up
had taken place.</p>

<p>The Mexican slowly pulled himself together to
reply. ‘Monte Vallejo is not being held in Arecibo.
In purgatorio, at this hour, so I trust. Ah,
it was magnificent!’</p>

<p>Mamie was now forgotten. Transformation in
the rurale was to be witnessed, moreover, at this
point. The man seemed higher, rising in his saddle
with enthusiasm. Here was one of the pride of
the Republic, indeed, having banished all present
care, in the thought of the recent exploits of his
troop, and especially of the light-hearted and
inimitable courage of his chief, Ramon Bistula,
el capitan, to whom the bandit’s capture was
largely due.</p>

<p>Tributes, dithyrambs, even—but no news.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>‘You say Monte Vallejo is dead—already put
to death?’</p>

<p>‘To-day. This very day, Señor.’</p>

<p>‘And by the hand of this famous captain of
your troop?’</p>

<p>‘Si, Señor.’</p>

<p>‘Where is your captain now?’ Elbert asked at
random.</p>

<p>‘In Arecibo—have no fear. The Señor will be
welcomed by el capitan Ramon, himself, who put
the bullet in the head of the chief of the bandits,
Monte Vallejo!’</p>

<p>Elbert struggled with his own composure.</p>

<p>‘I do not understand about your captain’s bullet—if
Monte was already taken captive—surely
he—’</p>

<p>‘This very day!’ exclaimed the rurale. ‘It was
so, Señor—a most charming thing! The great
Vallejo had many wounds at the time—many
wounds, but would not fall. Laughing, he stood
unbound—his head uncovered, trying to light
with wet fingers a second cigarette that would
not burn—’</p>

<p>‘I did not hear about the first. Please, not so
fast,’ said Elbert. ‘My Spanish is of the book—not
so fast, please—’</p>

<p>‘Ah, Señor, your Spanish is quite—Castillano,
quite. The Spanish of el capitan Ramon is
like that, also—’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>And this was the story that Elbert heard,
through many repetitions, as they rode forward
toward Arecibo:</p>

<p>‘... At daybreak this very day, seven men
put to death in the patio of el cuartel in Arecibo
by the limping idiots of Cordano who call themselves
soldiers. Seven prisoners, bound and blindfolded,
shot down by the soldiers of Cordano,
while Monte himself and el capitan, Ramon Bistula,
laughed and smoked and chatted together,
until there were no more prisoners standing, and
it became time for Monte himself to stand against
the wall.</p>

<p>‘No bandage for the eyes—ah, no, not for
such as he! No thongs for his hands—he waved
them away; then stepping carefully to avoid the
dead and shaking ones of his band, Monte took
his place against the blank wall—lighting another
cigarette.’</p>

<p>Elbert felt a frightful closeness about it all—this
very day, under this very sun, the town
where it happened, looming just ahead, the man
at his side, having witnessed it all. Moreover
Elbert was enduring a positive strain to know if
one of the bodies Monte Vallejo stepped over, as
he took his place at the wall, was Bart Leadley.
Not without great difficulty, his pressure was so
keen, did Elbert follow the details of the trooper’s
story, but the telling was folded over and over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>again on itself. It appeared that as Vallejo
lighted his cigarette, taking his place against the
wall, Ramon Bistula called to the soldiers not to
fire for a moment, until the chief of bandits had
taken one or two deep breaths of smoke.</p>

<p>‘... Such courtesy!’ exclaimed the enraptured
rurale, pouring out the rest. ‘And then it was, in
a moment more, with a gesture of thanks to my
captain, Señor Vallejo bowed his head for death,
but there was not one of the soldiers who cared
to put an end to such courage, and none could
fire straight in any case; so “boom-boom” from
the volleys and Monte Vallejo did not fall.’</p>

<p>Now the trooper swung his shoulders to the
right and left—unsettling the gait of his pony—in
the way of portraying the manner the doomed
bandit kept his feet.</p>

<p>‘Several times—in the arms and legs, struck,
Señor—yet smiling still and trying to light his
tobacco from which the fire had dropped—’</p>

<p>The trooper’s speech had become very rapid;
his bridle-rein changed from hand to hand, the
ears of his mount cocking with the gestures.
Here, manifestly, was the climax of his narrative.
Once he dropped the bridle-rein entirely, needing
both hands:</p>

<p>‘... Then it was that my captain, Ramon
Bistula, hastened forward, beckoning the soldiers
back. He caught the reeling Vallejo in his own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>hands. He held him still. From his own case he
drew a cigarette. He struck the match, lit it in
his own lips. He placed it in the lips of the other.
This I heard, “I have the honor in a moment to
end the work of these frightened butchers. You
are a brave man, Monte Vallejo! Speak, when
you would have me fire!”</p>

<p>‘And with that, such a beautiful look came
into the eyes of the bandit chief, as he said,
“Gracias, Capitan, your words and your tobacco
are of one excellence!” And after that, “I will
thank you now to put me to sleep, Brother
Ramon—”</p>

<p>‘It was then with his own hands—’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Florid life was closing in upon Elbert a bit too
fast. Riding in silence into Arecibo, he reflected
upon the quiet life of the leather-store, and upon
the manner of life he was entering upon right
now. He couldn’t have chatted and smoked like
Monte Vallejo. He couldn’t have done the elegant
butchery part of el capitan Ramon. It was
like the story of Red Ante—there just wasn’t
the stuff in him to endure certain phases of that,
nor the sort of thing pulled off in el cuartel, Arecibo,
this very day.</p>

<p>In so many cases in this country, he reflected,
one but arrived to the estate of manhood, when
he met death in violent form. And out of all this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>death, what hope for Bart Leadley, and the
rounding-out of that old bitter tale?</p>

<p>Elbert felt very confused and inadequate.</p>

<p>The little plaza, with only one building of more
than one story surrounding, and that el cuartel,
looked cold and forbidding to his eyes that late
afternoon; the little shops with dirt floors, where
old cheese and new rum struggled together to
reproduce the flavor of by-gone Spain, had lost
their accustomed romance. It was not until
Mamie was safely cared for in a clean corral by
herself; not, in fact, until her master sat down to
tortillas and huevos rancheros (the flavor of garlic
coming in from the open fireplace of the little
fonda)—that a certain wistful zest of life really
began to stir again in his veins once more. Black
tobacco in the air, black coffee sweetened to a
syrup.</p>

<p>‘If one could only live to enjoy all this,’ he
reflected, leaning back.</p>

<p>Dusk was already in the room—candle-lights
across the plaza, the first strum of guitars. At
this moment a young Mexican officer appeared;
elegantly dressed, and quite as Elbert might have
pictured such an entrance—whipping a riding
crop against his polished boot.</p>

<p>‘May I humbly present myself, Señor—I, Ramon
Bistula?’</p>

ONE SANG WITH GUITAR</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Elbert</span> arose, but before he caught himself, his
fascinated glance had darted to the gloved right
hand that had put the closing touch to Monte
Vallejo this very day. Not a bristling murderer
of outlaws, Ramon appeared, but a youth of cultured
turn of thought—brown eyes and boyish
lips, a face whiter than his own ... uninterested
apparently in soldiers, rurales, even in bandits,
but asking many questions regarding America,
the States and cities, the night life, and how long
it took to go from Chicago to San Francisco—</p>

<p>‘Not three days, Señor!’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Elbert.</p>

<p>‘Not three days, at fifty miles an hour, night
and day?’</p>

<p>Like a child—or, at least, a younger brother,
was this aristocrat who had taken the job of slaying
out of the hands of the despised soldiers of
Cordano. How many others had this small gloved
hand put to death? Elbert certainly felt under a
painful pull, as they chatted and complimented.
Secret stiffness was still upon him, as leisurely
together, they walked out of the fonda into the
starlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>‘Si a tu ventana llega una paloma—’ from
the guitars, and by this time the girls of Arecibo
were moving softly by. It was their brief hour of
night, and they were abroad, eyes shining, under
their mantillas; all from seven to the great age of
twenty-seven, passing by the beloved captain and
his friend, the American who came on the magnificent
horse. What did these soft-eyed girls think
of the killing manner of life of their men? Doubtless
that it was all that life should be.</p>

<p>With his absorbing interest in America, the
elegant Captain Ramon would certainly have
mentioned the detail—had there been an American
among the seven executed this day. Was
Bart more Mexican than American? Was he
regarded as a native, pure and simple, by his
fellow-bandits and the rurales, or had he left
Sonora altogether? These questions continually
hammered through Elbert’s consciousness. Meanwhile,
since compliments were the order in all
conversation, he was with difficulty trying to
convey to Ramon Bistula how enthusiastic the
trooper he had ridden with in the afternoon, had
expressed himself toward his captain.</p>

<p>‘Do all your men feel the same toward you?’
he inquired.</p>

<p>‘They are pleased with small things,’ lightly
said Ramon. ‘To-morrow, perhaps, you will see
the rest of my troop.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>‘They are not all here in Arecibo then?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, no—a third party is due to report at this
time. We look for further captives with them.
Six more of Vallejo’s men were brought in to-day
by a second squad.’</p>

<p>‘Six more prisoners here alive in Arecibo
now?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Señor, waiting death now in the patio of
el cuartel yonder—a mere formality—the paper
from General Cordano—any moment.’</p>

<p>Elbert turned his head away. ‘Great night for
guitars,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Ah, to hear the bands of countless pieces in the
great plazas of America!’</p>

<p>Elbert heard his own voice reach out plaintively
in the hush. ‘When do these further executions—?’</p>

<p>‘To-morrow—next day—who can tell? We
wait the order only. You care for these things?’</p>

<p>‘I could hardly say that, Captain. I was only
wondering at the manner in which the prisoners
face the end—if an American would act the
same?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, doubtless Americans would accept with
perfect composure—it is the least a man can
do—’</p>

<p>‘Are all these men calm?’</p>

<p>‘Again, please?’</p>

<p>‘Are they all calm?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>‘Calm. I had not thought of that! They are
so-so. Why not come with me now, and let us see
if they are calm.’</p>

<p>The Captain explained that he was due to
report at el cuartel at this time, but that his
personal quarters were in the fonda, the picket-line
of his own men being at the other side of
town. El cuartel, it was to be noted, was spoken
of with faint scorn, as the home of Cordano’s
soldiers—a poor-house and prison combined.</p>

<p>The two strolled across the plaza and the heavy
wooden gate of the quarters swung wide. Only
the front of the building had a second floor. It
was like a tunnel of clay they entered, wide and
high enough for a horseman to ride in, with a
narrow door leading to the barracks on one side
and to an office on the other. Elbert smelled the
earthiness of the dried clay walls, as he passed
through at the spurred heels of Ramon Bistula.
The suggestions of underground began to haunt
him—the presence of condemned men—this
very day—the blank wall!</p>

<p>The passage opened to a large patio with low
cells on all sides. The cells were open, the prisoners
and Cordano’s soldiers moving freely together.
Captain Ramon informed him that for a
time in the cool of the day like this the cells were
unlocked, but the prisoners were returned to
their quarters at nine promptly. Small fires were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>here and there; perhaps fifteen men in all, lounging
about the fires, the guards mixed freely among
them, ponies feeding in far corners. Some of the
men gambled. All smoked; one sang with guitar.
No sign of a face that might be an American. At
least, not for Elbert’s first fierce look. He noted
the inner blank wall of the barracks, but dusk
covered what stains might have been on the
ground.</p>

<p>To-morrow, the next day—six more of these
men to die—and they played cards to-night.
Tobacco was as good to them as ever; peace was
abroad ... one boyish voice sang, but Elbert
remembered the underground smell of the long
clay arch.</p>

<p>No American save himself in the prison court—no
troubled thoughts save his own apparently.
He moved from knot to knot among the fires,
Ramon Bistula having excused himself to enter
the office. The faces turned up to him from the
cards, from the interminable little match boxes
and papers of tobacco. The one with his guitar
looked up with a gray thin smile as he hummed,
but did not lose a beat of his song....</p>

<p>Scarred, pocked, peaceful faces—they did not
seem to know any more of what was coming than
the ponies in the farther shadow. There was one
with the luminous welt of a knife-wound, running
down the side of his throat and vanishing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>like the head of a worm under his collar ... boys
and men.</p>

<p>All smoked, and one sang with guitar.</p>

<p>Ramon Bistula approached, but only to excuse
himself again. Round and round among the little
fires, Elbert moved. No, he was not as they were.
It was as if in passing the clay tunnel to the little
court, something had fallen from them—ghastly
responsibility of self-preservation—the very
thing that choked his throat now.</p>

<p>He had paused a second time, before the feet of
the boyish figure with the guitar. The words of
the song were of some curious provincial Spanish,
and slowly uttered. It was this that the youth
sang:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>A girl once stood in a doorway and there was dust
of corn upon her elbow, upon her cheek, and pale
gold corn in a pile upon the mortar-stone at her side
... a girl with corn like sun-dust, shining on her skin
... with a golden bud springing like young corn in
her breast.</i></p></div>

<p>Something like that, chaste as the light of that
endless summertime. And the youth strumming
the guitar seemed not to feel the great wounding
of separation—but to take a vague sweetness
from repeating the words—as of approach to
that far doorway.</p>

<p>Elbert could stand the tension no longer.
Through his mind flicked memories of the supper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>in the old barefooted woman’s house in Nacimiento,
of the ride afterward, of the strange, still,
flowered room in Tucson. He longed to be alone,
his thoughts turned yearningly toward the fonda
of Arecibo; he longed to stand alone with Mamie
in the clean corral behind it. A sentry, one of the
soldiers of Cordano stopped him, as he started to
enter the portal from the patio.</p>

<p>‘I am leaving,’ he said. ‘I am with the captain
of the rurales—’</p>

<p>Ramon Bistula now came forward from the low
side door in the wall, and at the same instant, the
heavy wooden gate opened from the street, and
Mamie veered in under the arch, led by a soldier.
Another soldier followed, bearing the big stock-saddle
and blankets—Mamie entering this portal
of clay! He called her name; she nickered
back. Now Captain Ramon was saying:</p>

<p>‘I trust it will not be of great inconvenience—your
things being brought from the fonda for this
one night—you to pass this one night here, instead
of at the fonda—more air, more room—a
room being prepared, in fact, for yourself quite
alone.’</p>

<h2 id="XIX">XIX<br><br>
A CORNER OF THE WALL</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">A room</span> of his own. It was a cell with wooden
bars, looking out upon the court where the prisoners
and soldiers still played and lounged. A
huge moon, almost full, came up over the opposite
roof of low cells, and in the distant shadow
there, Mamie squealed and let fly—a plebeian
pony venturing too close, no doubt.</p>

<p>A sickish smile he was not aware of hung
around Elbert’s mouth. The floor of the cell was
of stone. The wooden bars very thick, the ceiling
low. There was a wide wooden bench for him to
lie upon—blanket roll, saddle, and saddle-bags
had been brought.... So the voluble rurale had
had but one idea all the time in the afternoon;
and crafty little Ramon Bistula with amiable
guile—so pleasantly impersonal in leading one
astray and putting men to death—Ramon, keeping
him in the plaza while his men doubtless went
through saddle-bags and roll. But they could
have found nothing to implicate him—some silver
and canned stuff. His papers of identification
were in order. Then he remembered his mention
of San Isidro; he would have to prove that Mamie
was not one of the stolen horses. Perhaps they
would think his papers were stolen, too!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>The sickish smile remained—the smile of one
who has seen his quest ending in failure. He
thought of Mr. Leadley’s affection and care for
Mamie, and he had known no better than to let
her show her speed on a highroad, and mention
the name of San Isidro to the rurale.</p>

<p>His hand came up to his mouth—an ache of
muscles that didn’t seem to know enough to relax
by themselves. The moonlight felt cold, a creeping
cold on the stone floor.... The same song
from the patio—guitar and corn-dust maiden—but
so different, coming to him through the bars.
El capitan was at the door, the sentry unlocking
the cell.</p>

<p>‘I have brought blankets of my own for you,
Señor. Very soft and warm blankets. I am
grieved; but it is only for the present—this interesting
mare of yours—a puzzle to the soldiers
of Cordano.... A very good night, Señor—’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He had actually dozed, for the plaza was
empty. Elbert had heard of people going to sleep
as usual, with death hanging over, but he wouldn’t
have believed it of himself. All was still, the
moon very white upon the turf. The blank wall
of the main building within forty feet from where
he lay.... This very morning ... word from Cordano
all that was necessary for more executions
... ‘mere formality.’ Now gradually, he entered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>one of the deep and memorable hours of his life,
lying propped up against the saddle, looking out
through the bars, moonlight flooding down outside,
everything so still that he could hear the
drops of water from the pail into the cistern in
the center of the prison patio. He waited for the
isolated drops, but his mind often wandered before
the sound came—back to his own house in
the East, to his own room, where he had dreamed
so much, but nothing like this—slowly through
the days at Heaslep’s and the leather-store; the
noon-hour in the latter place, when the door was
pushed open and a certain whimsical voice started
the whole works going:</p>

<p>‘The first thing cow-people does, when they
don’t know what to do—’</p>

<p>And that very saddle was under his head!
Heaslep’s again, Nacimiento. His Spanish book
said that word ‘Nacimiento’ meant Birth ...
the old Señora with her castanets, and her house
in the town called Birth.... Then the part he
never remembered clearly, not even now—the
ride to San Pasquali, the ride back; Nogales, its
smell of drugs, and the Letter; Tucson and that
still room where so many flowers were, still as the
patio out yonder.</p>

<p>Until just now, he had never let himself go, in
thinking about that room. Too much of a magnet
about it all; it drew all the strength of mind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>and feeling back to it, taking the force from the
work at hand here in Sonora. But this was a
sort of show-down—locked up here in Arecibo.
He dared now to remember that Tucson hour,
moment by moment.</p>

<p>... And what did she mean—that she could
see the car below—see right through it, and their
own bodies, sort of little and broken? He knew
what she meant. More than that, he knew her
meaning when she said, ‘And I could feel <i>our</i>
pain, but we were really together outside and
above.’ And ‘You were like one dead, yet you
still drove.’... ‘Your face was like stone, eyes
open, but no life, the skin pulled back over
the bones from behind.’... ‘It was when the
dawn came—the time we were in the awful
cold—’</p>

<p>Such a stillness around her as she spoke, the
stillness of the mountains. He didn’t remember
that dawn part after reaching Nogales, but she
remembered it all. There was another thing now
that he dared to ponder a moment, because he
was locked up in this place of birth—no, death.
‘We will know all about everything when the
time comes.’ How much did she mean by that?</p>

<p>It would likely be a lot harder to keep on looking
for Bart, after letting these memories have
their way, but was there to be any more mission?
Was this not the end—a cell in Arecibo? His
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>eyes focalized again on the moonlit patio. Deserted
and ashen white now, but he was seeing
once more the figures of the condemned men—that
face of the youth with the guitar and song
of the corn-dust maiden—one of the boys who
had ridden with Monte Vallejo, ridden with Bart,
perhaps.</p>

<p>Elbert had fallen asleep and awakened again
to find the silvery sheen gone from the patio.
Gray light was there, but no moonlight. A calling
of Mexican names:</p>

<p>‘Revas—Marcè—Trastorno—Sarpullir—’</p>

<p>There were one or two more, but he missed
hearing the names, curiously struck by the meaning
of the last ‘Sarpullir’—‘to be covered with
flea-bites,’ as he recalled from his Spanish book.
Now the clanging of an iron door broke in upon
him, and a thudding on the turf, which he recognized
without having heard it before—the dropping
of rifle-butts as the pieces were stacked.
The Mexican voice was still carrying on. It made
him think of the voice of the phonograph record
back home, announcing the singer of ‘La Paloma.’</p>

<p>Straight across the patio, one of the sentries
was unlocking a cell door. The sentry stood
back, as the prisoner emerged. Neither hurried.
The prisoner made the sign of the cross, and then
held forth his hand. The sentry gave him a cigarette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
and struck the match on his own box.
Then they moved forward—out of sight.</p>

<p>Elbert was on his feet now, rubbing his eyes.
It had all been mixed with his dream so far, but
now he knew that it was really dawn and the
Mexican voice was telling off the deaths of ‘Sarpullir’
and the others. The one across the patio
had moved forward to the wall.</p>

<p>It was altogether incredible. The rurale’s story
of yesterday, all the stories of death he had ever
heard, did not make the present moment believable.
It could not be so, here and now.... Men
fell off horses, off cliffs, out of parachutes; men
were run over by cars, blown to pieces in mines,
broken by many labors and inventions, but men
could not be put to death—a’ sangre fria—at
daybreak by other men!</p>

<p>Now he was standing at the bars of his own
cell. Something was pulling him back to the
bench, but another force more rigidly held his
right cheek-bone pressed between two wooden
bars. Only the far corner of the wall could be
seen, even so—just one man standing at the
blank wall—face of a youth, looking away, head
uncovered and looking away.... And now from
the left, where Elbert’s eye could not reach,
came an old man’s voice raised in wailing. It was
like the voice of an old beggar at some city
gate—crying out softly against what he saw,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>not desperately, a low mourning; and all the time
the phonograph-voice gave commands—until a
shock of volley-fire and a few ragged shots.</p>

<p>The hands of the youth lifted, as if he were
treading water, as if he were pushing something
from him, as if he were trying not to fall—an
altogether different, divided look—the face of
one being stoned, yet exalted, too—all this in
the succession of shots, and Elbert had drawn
back by this time, rubbing his cheek which was
bruised from the wood, and there was something
in him older, far older and quieter, than he had
ever known before; something in him that could
not laugh yet, but would sometime, something
that knew that the corn-dust maiden would be
waiting in that far doorway.</p>

<h2 id="XX">XX<br><br>
THE TWO WHO HAD NOT HEARD</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Day</span> was actually breaking clearer. Mamie was
dancing at her tether across the patio. The recent
sound of guns had not been to her liking, nor
certain odors which now moved in the air. The
firing squad had gathered at the cistern. The
men were drinking water and lighting cigarettes,
talking jerkily with laughter. The sudden surge
of pity which Elbert knew was for them, not for
the others.... That was his day of quiet waiting.
The sun rose and steadily shone; such was a fact
of continual amazement. The hours didn’t drag,
because his thoughts were out of himself so much
of the time. He would finally feel an ache in his
body and rouse from the deeps of contemplation
to find that he had sat in one position for an hour
or more. Queerly enough, he couldn’t take his
own predicament so seriously as last night.</p>

<p>Of course, he wouldn’t give up. He would see
his Sonora job through, but for the time, practically
all sense of personal danger had eased away.
Cordano’s little infantry garrison was merely
holding him until his case was straightened out.
Perhaps the officer in charge had telegraphed
North to verify his papers. Sooner or later he
would be out of this, and if they sent him back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>to the States, he would return when possible and
start in all over again.</p>

<p>Noon, afternoon. Captain Ramon appeared,
commiserated with him, but announced that four
more of Monte Vallejo’s men were being brought
in. Elbert saw the prisoners enter at nightfall,
and once more, for an hour or two in the evening,
the prison cells were unlocked, and after that the
silence again, the lone American’s last thought
that there would be another death party at
dawn....</p>

<p>He was ripped out of sleep by a full-powered
neigh from Mamie. He sat up—moonlight whiter
than ever upon the empty patio. Faintly he
could see the mare standing in the thin shadows—that
high-held listening head—the arch of
her crest. He heard a horse answer from a distance,
probably from the picket-line of the rurales
across the town. A sentry walking past, back and
forth across the entrance to the arch, paused, but
resumed his pacing again.</p>

<p>Now, slowly, on the low roof of the cells opposite,
a human figure lifted—then another. Mamie
nickered; the figures flattened again. This time
horses answered from both sides of the town.
The sentry was slower to resume his pacing.</p>

<p>Elbert rubbed his eyes. The two figures on
hands and knees were now moving cautiously
forward on the roof of the cells toward the arch.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>They came to halt, as the sentry approached
below. Slow seconds, Mamie dancing nervously
back and forth on her tether. From one of the
cells came a low grumbling at the disturbance she
made—then the launching of the nearer and
shorter figure from the roof, to the shoulders of
the sentry, as the latter reached the turning-point
of his post below.</p>

<p>Hardly a scream. The sentry was stretched
upon the turf; the other rising from it. The second
and taller stranger, meanwhile, had dropped
down from the roof and vanished under the arch.
Sleepy voices from the cells; a hissing command
to silence; the name of Monte Vallejo spoken—another
demand for silence in a tone of suppressed
fury.</p>

<p>And now the taller of the two strangers reappeared
from under the arch, leading by the hand
a second sentry, who proved to have in his hands
the keys of the cells. The name of Monte Vallejo
seemed on every lip. Some of the prisoners in the
cells appeared to know the two who had come,
but kept repeating that Monte Vallejo was dead.
Could it be possible that these two strangers had
not heard? With this question in his brain, Elbert
began to realize that the two who had come over
the roof were of Vallejo’s band—on a long
chance to rescue their chief.</p>

<p>The soldier with the keys was now being forced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>to unlock the cells, and the way of this forcing by
the tall bandit, began to fascinate Elbert in spite
of his own suffocating tension. No savagery
about it; the voice was cool, hasteless. Lilt and
leisure in his words, as he forced the sentry from
cell to cell, twirling a gun on his first finger. ‘He
could fan it, too—’ an old sentence of Bob Leadley’s
flashed through Elbert’s brain. The shorter
bandit now hurried up, breathlessly reiterating
the fact of Monte Vallejo’s death.</p>

<p>‘So I hear,’ said the tall one, ‘but we can turn
loose the boys still alive, can’t we?’</p>

<p>‘But the soldiers are awaking, Señor—’</p>

<p>‘I locked the door to the barracks,’ coolly
answered the other. ‘Cordano’s men will have
to get down into the street from the upper windows....
We can’t leave these men while we’re at
it. Tell everybody to be quiet.... Pronto, hombre,’
he added lightly to the soldier with the keys.</p>

<p>Sounds of the soldiers’ arousing was heard from
the upper floor of el cuartel facing the street.</p>

<p>‘Pronto, hombre—’ the tall bandit repeated.
‘We’ll fight our way to the horses—’</p>

<p>Elbert in the dark of the cell was folding his
blankets in a distracted way, fascinated at the
same time by that easy flowing voice of the tall
one. He was drawing on his boots—the keys
sounding nearer. Another of Mamie’s nasal protests
reached his ears. Would they take her?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>The thought actually weakened him—hardly a
chance for men of Monte Vallejo to miss one of
her kind in the moonlight. And now, standing
at the bars of his own cell door—the tall one—that
voice, the sentry beside him with the keys,
wailing:</p>

<p>‘No bantit aqui, Señor,—esta ’Mericano. Caballero
’Mericano—’</p>

<p>‘American?’ queried the bandit in English.
‘Oh, I say, in there—is that right?’</p>

<p>Elbert cleared his voice: ‘That you, Bart?’</p>

<p>‘What the hell—?’ same genial tone.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I am American. I come from your
father—’</p>

<p>‘Open, hombre!’ the command now, and, ‘I
don’t know you. You’re a lot safer where you
are, but I’m letting you out.’</p>

<p>‘I came down for you. I’ve got a horse—’</p>

<p>Banging was now heard at the lower door to
the barracks.</p>

<p>‘You’ll have to saddle fast. The soldiers are
sure coming-to, but they can only get out the
upper windows.’</p>

<p>For just a second, as the cell door swung,
Elbert saw the lift of a dark face—a glitter to
the laugh, that low, easy flowing tone; then he
was running across the moonlit patio—saddle-blankets
over his left arm, saddle itself trailing
from his right hand, a call on his lips for the mare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>to stand round. The blankets fell in place;
cinches came to hand. Mamie’s clean warm
mouth closed over the bit, her ears wiggled
straight in the head stall. Still, Elbert was the
last man out of the patio, Bart standing in the
street, covering the flight of his men. Shots
rained down from the windows of the second floor
of the barracks. A few of Cordano’s soldiers had
already dropped down to the street; others were
crashing at the lower door which Bart had locked.</p>

<p>‘The horses are in the hollow back of the quarters!’
he yelled in Mexican.</p>

<p>The hand of one soldier reached up to Mamie’s
bridle-rein, but Bart’s pistol-butt thudded upon
the bone. Even in the tumult, Elbert saw that
nothing escaped Bart—that he was marvelously
on the job, but cool.</p>

<p>‘Follow the others, stranger!’ he called now.
‘I didn’t catch your name!’</p>

<p>‘Get up here behind me, don’t you want to?’
Elbert answered above the din.</p>

<p>‘Thanks, no. It’s only a little ways to the
horses.’</p>

<p>The dark laughing face was upturned again for
an instant, and at this moment, from beyond the
plaza across the town, came the first trumpet
call of the rurales.</p>

<p>A rush past the small closed huts of Arecibo,
women’s voices uttering prayers—guttural tones
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>of frightened men—the signal from the hollow,
where other horses were waiting. Elbert saw
their pricked ears in the whitish light—nine or
ten horses apparently, three men in charge. The
released prisoners mounted at random, but Bart
cleared from the tangle on a leaping wheeling
mount that looked ashen-colored in the moonlight.
A cracking of rifles from behind, the soldiers
now having broken out the lower door. The
rurales quartered across the town, couldn’t have
gained the road so soon. Mamie had forged to
the lead; at least, she was now abreast with the
hound-bodied runner Bart sat.</p>

<p>‘That’s some horse you’re sittin’, Mister!’ the
big fellow called. ‘Some more to her, too—she
just can’t help it, can she? And handles with a
light hand!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes,’ said Elbert.</p>

<p>He felt the strangest lift in his chest—Mamie
beneath, Bart and the ashen runner at his side—a
sorrel, to show that color in the moonlight—scatter
of shots from behind, the deep whimsical
voice again from his side:</p>

<p>‘I say, amigo mio—did you hold up a race-track
special, too? They tell me I’m riding a
stake-horse—old Mallet-head, here—but your
mare isn’t asking any odds!’</p>

<p>‘She belonged to your father,’ Elbert answered
throatily.</p>

<h2 id="XXI">XXI<br><br>
THE RIO MORENO BRIDGE</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">They</span> were out of the town, riding west through
open country—ten men, including himself, Elbert
counted, one led-horse trailing. Bart had
fixed the pace of the sorrel at a full run, but still
Mamie had to be held in, not to forge ahead.
Finally the words from Bart:</p>

<p>‘I don’t hear much American—but that didn’t
sound so cheerful—“belonged,” you said?’</p>

<p>Elbert had to stop to recall his last words. He
had said the mare he rode ‘belonged’ to Bart’s
father.</p>

<p>‘Yes, that’s what I meant,’ he called back. ‘I
came down from him—at the last—’</p>

<p>For a full minute, only the drum of hoofs; then
from Bart, as steadily as before:</p>

<p>‘Some night for news—Monte Vallejo and
this about Dad—same night.’</p>

<p>‘But I’ve got a lot to say to you from him!’
Elbert answered above the roar. ‘In case anything
happens to separate us—I want you to
know he has left you some money—quite a lot
of money.’</p>

<p>‘Struck gold at the last?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, the mine’s rich, too—a gold tooth, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>calls it,’ Elbert went on, absurdly. ‘Only filed
the top off her so far. If I don’t get a chance to
tell you all about it—you go to Mort Cotton,
the cattleman at San Forenso—’</p>

<p>‘Say, amigo mio, aren’t you expecting to live?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but I’ve been carrying this message all
summer. Been down here looking for you—long
time. Remember—Mort Cotton at San Forenso—he’ll
fix you up, and I want to tell you, your
father never forgot—but kept thinkin’ about
you—ever since Red Ante—’</p>

<p>His relief was inexpressible for a minute. He
had made good, if there was not another word
spoken. ‘One of the finest men I ever knew!’
he added.</p>

<p>No answer from Bart.</p>

<p>Now gradually Elbert began to realize he was
running with what was left of Monte Vallejo’s
band. There hadn’t been any time to think or
choose back in el cuartel. He had jumped at the
chance to ride out with Bart; that meant he had
cast his lot with the bandits; identified once and
for all with a fragment of the outlaws, now hunted
from all quarters of Sonora. Still, a kind of freedom
throbbed in him, his nostrils dilated to the
smell of dust in the night—a man beside, a
horse beneath. Finally above the thud of hoofs,
Bart’s voice again:</p>

<p>‘What did they lock you up for?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>‘My mare, Mamie here, I guess. They thought
she was one of the race-horses—’</p>

<p>‘Thought you were one of us,’ Bart chuckled.
‘How long have you been locked up?’</p>

<p>‘Last night—or night before last—if it’s getting
on toward morning.’</p>

<p>‘Two hours to daybreak yet.’</p>

<p>In the silence after that, Elbert became queerly
aware that Bart wanted to ask more about his
father, but couldn’t get his voice to working.
The words reached him:</p>

<p>‘So they kicked off Monte yesterday morning?’</p>

<p>‘Day before yesterday—’</p>

<p>‘You weren’t there then?’</p>

<p>‘No, but they told me he had the nerve—that
Bistula of the rurales, himself, finished the job.
The soldiers wouldn’t shoot straight!’</p>

<p>‘I sure wanted to get to Monte in time,’ Bart
said, queerly. ‘The game’s up, with him gone—’</p>

<p>Did he mean he regarded their own capture as
inevitable? After another pause, Bart asked:
‘And what do you get, Mister, for coming down
here and mixing up in this?’</p>

<p>‘Your father arranged all that. We were
friends, you know—’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you know you’re in bad, ridin’ with this
outfit?’</p>

<p>‘I took the job—’</p>

<p>‘Better if I’d left you locked up in that cell.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>You’re along with what’s left of a losing game—’
Bart’s laugh sounded forlorn as he added: ‘Why,
they’re after us from every town—’</p>

<p>Elbert cleared his throat ‘You see, I took the
job—’</p>

<p>His eye had fastened on the north star as he
spoke. It was over his right shoulder, so they
were riding west. He could see the mountains
lying northward there in the moonlight. A sudden
passion mounted in him to turn north right
now; to ride straight north, crossing the Border
with Bart, yonder in the mountains where there
were no roads; to find himself in the States with
Bart, asking the way to San Forenso; after that,
the trail west to the cabin, his mind finishing the
picture in a flash—with Mamie and the sorrel
safe in the corral. The deep laughing voice at
his left:</p>

<p>‘I guess when you take a job, you try to see it
through, don’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Elbert in fainter tone. He was deeply
drawn to the man he had come for. Sometimes
it was as if Cal Monroid were riding at his side;
sometimes a feeling of Mr. Leadley’s presence.</p>

<p>‘I’d like to get you out of this, Mister, but it’s
a sort of tight web—’</p>

<p>Silence and hard riding after that; finally Bart
called a halt for a few seconds to listen or get his
bearings. There was a scratching of matches in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>the outfit as he pressed on again—the interminable
little boxes and sheaves of tobacco.</p>

<p>‘Don’t hear ’em behind. The town of Alphonso
is about five miles ahead, I figure. Another squad
of rurales stationed there—’</p>

<p>‘Telegraph in between?’ Elbert asked.</p>

<p>‘I’m not sure; not along this road, anyway.
May be a roundabout wire. I’m taking the
chance to reach the bridge of Rio Moreno. Two
miles yet.’</p>

<p>They galloped on. The moon was tilting over
toward the west. It must have been after three.
He saw the lather on Mamie’s neck, yet he was
still holding her in. A wooden bridge loomed
ahead. Bart pulled up, and turned off the main
road to a parallel sandy track at the right, leading
down to the water. He didn’t mean to cross
the bridge, Elbert perceived. The arroyo was
broad and filled with stones, but the horses
smelled water ahead. Mamie was whipping her
head up and down, trying to take the bit. Now
Elbert saw the mare’s ears cock suddenly, and
knew she had caught something in the wind.
His hand shot down to shut off her breath, but
the nicker broke out in spite of him.</p>

<p>An answer in kind from under the bridge.
Then a volley from the same source, Elbert’s
second experience under rifle fire that night—venomous
roaring of slugs in the air. He never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>could have dreamed how utterly malignant the
sounds. That instant at his right hand (Bart was
still at his left) it was as if the picture unfolded
for his eyes alone—an upturned face, then a
crumpled, falling body, horse leaping aside—empty
saddle—one of the four released from
the prison at Arecibo. In the midst of the shots,
a yell from Bart:</p>

<p>‘We split right here, men!’</p>

<p>Elbert heard certain names shouted—those
who were to turn back, those to ride north.
Then Bart’s face jerked around to him. ‘This
way for us, Mister, we ride together.’</p>

<p>Their horses were at full run, along the river-bed,
where the clear sand showed at the edge of
the stream—shots still peppering after.</p>

<p>‘Your mare!’ Bart laughed. ‘Why, they’d
have gotten all of us, if she hadn’t given warning!
We’d have gone right into their gun-barrels under
the bridge!’</p>

<p>‘She’s one more listening mare,’ Elbert called
back.</p>

FRAMED IN A DOBE GATEWAY</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">North</span>, they were riding straight north, though
the going for a way was a bit heavy through the
sand and stones.</p>

<p>‘Not so fast quite!’ Bart warned. ‘The other
three can’t keep up—’</p>

<p>Elbert was bending forward because the rurales
were following, their shots still in the air.
His heart was filled with elation that Mamie had
given the warning, and that their course had
turned north. He had forgotten the three of
Bart’s men still riding with them. More shots
from behind, a queer gulping cough from Bart.</p>

<p>‘Are you hurt?’ Elbert called.</p>

<p>‘Yes, one of ’em got me. I’ve—been—hit—before—but
not so close in—’</p>

<p>Elbert’s hand tightened; his eyes still held to
the north star. ‘Can you ride a ways?’</p>

<p>‘Sure. Long as you do—’</p>

<p>‘Don’t forget to give me a warning, if you’re
going to—’</p>

<p>‘I’m not going to fall, amigo mio! They’ll
never get us now, but our three behind—we’re
ridin’ too fast for their ponies!’</p>

<p>Elbert did not look back; nor did he check
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>Mamie’s speed. This was the instant he realized
he was in command of affairs, if anybody was.
His momentary concern wasn’t with the three
bandits, whipping their ponies to hold the pace,
but with the one who called him “amigo mio”
and bent forward now as if pushing the saddle
from him.</p>

<p>The sorrel galloped at Mamie’s side with great
easy leaps. To keep going with Bart was Elbert’s
game, not with this remnant of Vallejo’s band; to
keep going north with Bart at any price; to turn
loose the horses faster and faster, their heads to
the north—if only Bart could stay in his seat!
The river road running north assumed clearer
outline—wheel-tracks, a hardening pebbled way.
Again from his companion:</p>

<p>‘We’re ridin’ too fast for the others, Mister—’</p>

<p>‘I think we’d better not wait for anybody now,
Bart. This is a running match right now, while
you’re in the saddle. Who’s got the stuff—that’s
what we’re going to find out—Mamie
here or your Mallet-head!’</p>

<p>A chuckle in answer. ‘You’re the doctor!’</p>

<p>Elbert bent forward. ‘I say, Mamie, we’re off!’
She knew that tone—a wide-open throttle, it
meant, and the big sorrel settled lower at the
left, his fish eye fixed on her nose.</p>

<p>Now part of Elbert’s private reaction to the
headlong pace was the sense that he had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>fixing for this race all his life—a sort of climax
of all days, and his eyes glanced often up to old
Polaris, as if the north star were a silver cup for
the winner. A distance-course, seconds pounding
on into minutes, the minutes into tens, dusk of
earliest morning blent with the low moon’s rays;
only two horses in the finish, silence as deep from
behind now as from the desolate foothills ahead—a
friend to stick by at his left—white smile,
two slits of black for eyes, body hanging forward.</p>

<p>Every little while: ‘Don’t fall, Bart! Give me
a word if you’re slipping!’</p>

<p>‘I’m not going to fall, Mister—’</p>

<p>The river had narrowed to a creek; the road
to a path; the blowing horses pelted forward on
rising ground—</p>

<p>Then it was all as queer as a dream. Breaking
day, a face framed in a dobe gateway, a face by
the side of the road. Just a glimpse—girl or
child or woman, he did not know—but a face in
the ashen light—oval beauty in the gateway of
a dobe wall! Elbert’s head flung back as they
passed, but the face was gone. That instant
thickly from Bart:</p>

<p>‘Pull up, pardner!’</p>

<p>Elbert’s hand went out to the left, as he drew
Mamie sharply in with the other. The look of
death was on Bart’s face; his lips moved.</p>

<p>‘Big town ahead—Fonseca—three miles or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>so. Rurales—they’ll be waitin’ for us there—’
The gamy head rocked back, the spine drooping
sideways.</p>

<p>‘We’re not going there,’ said Elbert, leaping
down. ‘God, how you’ve sat it out! You can
fall now—I’m underneath!’</p>

<p>‘I’m not goin’ to fall—’ Bart mumbled, but
his hand relaxed on the pommel.</p>

<p>Elbert looked forward and back; not a sign
of life either way, but the face at the dobe gate
was strangely before his inner eyes. Something
queerly to do with the song of the corn-dust
maiden in that far doorway, it seemed to have
for him. His face lifted to the cold gray of the
dawn-lit sky. Rurales still following possibly ...
‘mere formality’ ... blank wall ... oval beauty.</p>

<p>Now he was carrying Bart back, leading both
horses.</p>

<p>‘I’m taking a chance to get you a berth,’ he
gasped, coming in sight of the dobe gateway, now
empty.</p>

<p>An aperture in a dobe wall for a gate—face
gone. Over the gate as he led the horses into the
yard, his eye caught the letters formed of faded
tile, ‘El Relicario.’ He fancied the movement of
a dress through a low arbor ahead. Still with his
burden, he moved toward it.</p>

<p>She was there—in the doorway of a broad low
dobe ruin. He seemed at first to see only her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>wide eyes. And then his Spanish came to him
and words inspired by another’s need—pressure
he had never felt back of an effort before.</p>

<p>‘Look, Señorita—he must have shelter and
care—my companion! Will you not give help
to him? I will pay a great price!’</p>

<p>The girl made no sound, her eyes fixed on
Bart’s back, where Elbert’s hands pressed a dark
saturation.</p>

<p>‘May I take him into your house for shelter,
Señorita?’ he panted.</p>

<p>She led the way indoors, halting in a large, all
but empty room.</p>

<p>‘There are those who want his life,’ Elbert said
unsteadily under his burden. ‘May I not take
him farther in?’</p>

<p>She turned instantly toward an inner door.</p>

<h2 id="XXIII">XXIII<br><br>
FENCELESS FOOTHILLS OF SONORA</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">There</span> was a room in which he saw a full-sized
harp in its shroud; there was a trellised patio,
two great ollas standing on the heaved tiles and
jasmine vines very thick and ancient. At the far
corner, in the gray morning light, stood an elderly
man with bared head. To him, the señorita gave
the signal of silence with her finger touching her
lips, and also to an old woman in the latticed
kitchen.... Ruin of an old plantation house,
very large, some of the windows unglazed; El
Relicario—the name ran through Elbert’s brain
which throbbed from the stress of his burden—all
this a matter of seconds only.</p>

<p>Then a corridor and a little room to the left—queer
warmth rising in Elbert’s heart, as he placed
Bart upon a cot that had recently been slept in.
The sense came to him that this was a kind of
sanctuary—a cross upon the wall, a white flower
beneath, the girl standing against the wall, her
arms slightly lifted, her hands toward the long
booted figure on her own cot. Elbert bent over
Bart now—a rush of memories of the day he
had brought his father to the cabin and set him
down like this. The eyes were looking up to him;
the lips moved with hardly audible words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>‘Back at the gate—as we turned in—the
tracks of our horses!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sure, I’ll fix them.’ Then he added:
‘Listen, can you hear me, Bart?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sure—’</p>

<p>‘I’m going to ride on and leave you here. I’m
taking both horses—so the rurales won’t stop,
but follow me on. I’ll hide in the foothills to-day,
and circle back here to-night or to-morrow night.’</p>

<p>‘I hate to see you go, but you’re—you’re the
doctor!’ Bart laughed. ‘About the sorrel—he
knows the whip, but goes mad under a spur—just
a pointer in handling him—but you know
a horse.’</p>

<p>Elbert’s jaw hardened. ‘Thanks, I’ll remember,’
he said.</p>

<p>The voice went on faintly: ‘I didn’t miss how
you handled the mare!’</p>

<p>‘You didn’t miss—anything!’ Elbert replied,
fearing the other was delirious from his wound.</p>

<p>‘Sorry—you go—’</p>

<p>‘It’s the only way. Adios, Bart—and to you,
Señorita, this—’</p>

<p>He placed two gold pieces on the table, but
saw her hurt and troubled look, as she came forward
from the wall.</p>

<p>‘You see, I’m leading them away from him!’
he said, as if the point were of great moment to
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>Bart’s hand lifted; but his face was cut off by the
girl’s bending profile. Queer joy lived in him from
Bart’s recent words about his handling of the
mare, but a sudden weariness came over him, too,
as he turned away. A nicker outside answered
his step as he hastened across the broken stonework
of the patio. Mamie had never before been
left unceremoniously to cool in a yard—in company
with a stranger.</p>

<p>He led the horses out to the road; no sight or
sound so far at least, from the direction he had
come. Leaving them standing on the highway,
he reëntered the gate and began fanning out the
hoof-marks in the yard, using his broad hat. Out
through the gate again, he worked until all was
clear; then mounted and pushed on, leading the
sorrel.</p>

<p>Day was brightening among the foothills. The
big range he had ridden toward through the
night was now intimately uncovered on his right
hand; Fonseca, three miles straight ahead, Bart
had said. Both horses were pulling toward the
creek. They were too hot for a deep drink, but
might have a few draughts without harm. Besides,
he must replenish his pack-canteen.</p>

<p>The sorrel fought to drink his fill. Elbert had
to climb into Bart’s saddle to get the big fellow
out of the stream. Back on the road again, he
followed for about a quarter of a mile, toward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>Fonseca, before turning eastward to the mountains.
He had left a clear trail so far, and now
off the road, he began to weave back and forth
along the stony waste, following a vague idea
to confuse and delay pursuit, being well past the
old dobe house. Bart would have done all this
better, he thought, recalling how the other, half
dead, had not forgotten to tell him to wipe out
the tracks leading from the road in through the
dobe wall.</p>

<p>Many minutes afterward, he came to a halt
upon an eminence and looked down, at a frail
low smoke pattern of the town to the north.
Also he glanced back to familiarize himself with
the lay of the land around El Relicario. The hills
shut him off from much of the road; he caught no
glimpse of possible pursuit. Still later in full
sunlight he halted in a rift between the hills and
forked out a few mouthfuls of breakfast from a
glass jar of frijoles, packed in his saddle-bags at
San Isidro three days before.</p>

<p>Now in a rush it closed upon him—the heaviness,
the coldness, the blur of fatigue. Languidly,
he set to work upon the horses. They were
sweated out, cakes of dust and salt at the cinchlines
and blanket-edges, both restlessly athirst,
but apparently not lastingly hurt by the long
gallop of the night. He took off only one saddle at
a time; holding the other ready instantly to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>mount and be off at the first sight or sound, working
meanwhile with wisps of grass and cloths from
his kit. Strange, it seemed, to play the groom
to another than Mamie; unfamiliar, the bones
and textures of this rangy gelding; no curiosity or
particular affection from the sorrel runner such
as Elbert was accustomed to. Running was what
this one knew, but Mallet-head was presently
adapting his taste, nevertheless, to the scant sun-dried
grass with better grace than the mare. She
couldn’t see why a stop should be made in this
waterless, fenceless wilderness. Standing by, she
nudged the man’s arm repeatedly for light on
the subject.</p>

<p>‘Night-running’s all right with her,’ he mused,
‘but she doesn’t get the inconveniences of being
a bandit’s mare.’</p>

<p>His thoughts were running queerly from so
many shocks and tensions. The sun was well
above the eastern mountains, but not yet nine
in the morning—just about the time he used to
be getting to the leather-store. Fenceless foothills
of Sonora, a wearing grind of thoughts and
questions. Little inner room—cross and white
flower and cot so recently slept in. Did the
señorita always get up so early? Were the old
people her parents? How had it all been arranged
with so few words, as if some power intervened
to help in a pinch? Was Bart going to live, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>would it be as it was with his father? Had the
rurales by this time stopped at that open dobe
gateway? Had it been yellow of him to run away
from the other three bandits?</p>

<p>He began to think he had done rather poorly.
If Bart had held the lead, he wouldn’t have run
away from his men. Bart had spoken of the matter
three or four times after his wound, and then
given up—‘You’re the doctor!’ In the thick
bruised feeling of his brain, Elbert’s depression
deepened. He recalled his bad judgment in letting
Mamie out—so close to Arecibo, and in
telling the rurale that he had come from San
Isidro.</p>

<p>The sickish smile came again to his lips. He
wasn’t much for this sort of life; he ought to be
driving a car, a truck, possibly. He recalled his
funk in the prison at Arecibo, even before he was
locked up, and afterward in the cell—and how
the bandits had given themselves to death. ‘...
peaceful to be with like cattle. I don’t mean
they’re cattle, only that they loll around and
ruminate like ’em,’ old Bob Leadley had said,
summing up the whole matter in the remark that
he wished he had treated the Mexicans as well as
they treated him.</p>

<p>Moreover, the old man had found out that
there were times when a man couldn’t wash his
hands. ‘Wasn’t that just what I did about the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>other three?’ Elbert questioned, squinting up at
the sky. Now a painful rush of pictures went
through his brain—the wall in the prison patio,
the corner of the wall—only yesterday morning—standing
at the bars of the cell.</p>

<p>He caught himself rubbing his right cheek.</p>

<p>No, there was something in him that didn’t
belong to this sort of life. As for Red Ante, he
couldn’t have done the thing Bart did—he
couldn’t have lived through it, as Bart’s father
did.</p>

<p>All day the horses kept their heads turned down
hill. They snipped the sparse grass—eyes and
ears and muzzles stretched toward distant hollows—all
instincts fixed upon unseen water.
Elbert didn’t trust the sorrel, not even to tether
him, but kept a hand on his bridle-rein. Once he
dozed and was awakened from a thirst dream by
the sound of horses sucking in water from a stony
stream.</p>

<p>... Mexico with her quaint, gentle ways—a
plaintive singing voice ‘carved out of starlight’—but
underneath—violence. Men fell to killing
each other. Just so much of all this killing
a man could stand, and no more. How had Bart
stood it for so long? Bart wasn’t like that, himself.
He hadn’t even roughed it with the soldier
of the keys in the Arecibo prison—not even in
that moment of fierce danger and haste! ... and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>that easy flowing voice of coolness and laughter
and daring, but how had Bart dared to put Palto
out of his misery?</p>

<p>Elbert pondered a long time, finally remembering
how he had felt the need of carrying Bart
deeper and deeper into the house, as if he had
known all the time there was an inner room.
When he reached there and had laid his burden
down—a sudden sense of peace had come over
him. What was the meaning of that? With his
eyelids closed he saw a light shining through alabaster.
Yes, he had met one who would know the
meaning and could answer this.... But what
was the meaning of the power that had seemed to
come to him to make the señorita understand
with so few words?...</p>

<p>Cross and white flower—Spanish-faced girl
standing back against the wall... Elbert dozed
again, and the inner room of El Relicario and the
still flowered room of Tucson softly, magically
folded into one. It seemed quite easy and natural.</p>

<p>A grim day, his nerve at lowest ebb, nothing of
the lift or glow he had known in moments of last
night’s riding with Bart. Would they ever ride
together again? Was Bart lying dead now in that
inner room?</p>

<p>Fenceless foothills of Sonora—ages in a day!
He didn’t feel quite sane, riding down to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>creek in the dusk at last. He couldn’t hold his
mind to thought of danger, but to water only.
Mamie smelled it and could scarcely be held in;
the sorrel plunged at her side.</p>

SHEATH-KNIFE</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">In</span> full darkness he left the two horses fastened
among the alders of the stream bed and started
for the dobe house. At least, there were no horses
of rurales waiting at the gateway of El Relicario,
nor any lights to be seen in front; but moving
around to the side, he fancied a faint ashen shaft
farther on from an unglazed window. He knocked.
A pall seemed to have fallen upon the world—before
the step, the moving candle—and the
señorita’s face, finger pressed across her lips as
she pointed to the little room. Then he was following
her candle through the passage.</p>

<p>There was Bart—bloodless, startlingly altered,
but asleep, not dead, as he had thought in
the first flash. And presently, Elbert began to feel
himself standing about like a stranger. Either he
hadn’t seen straight at daybreak, or the señorita
had become a woman since then; no face of a
peon girl by a lonely roadway, this woman of El
Relicario to whom he had offered coins, but of
one risen to emergencies, as only quality and
breeding can arise. She had led him out into a
hallway and was speaking as one who had found
her place and work in life.</p>

<p>‘He will be so glad to hear you have come. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>have said you would return, but he could not be
sure. There is food for you waiting—please
come.’</p>

<p>He followed her through a firelit room, where
the elderly man he had seen in the patio in the
morning, arose and bowed with courtly grace,
and from behind him the faded-faced woman
smiled in the manner of far-off times. A wooden
table, a pitcher of milk, corn-bread and rubbery
cheese of goat’s milk—but Elbert hardly tasted
what he put in his mouth.</p>

<p>Horsemen had ridden by in the early morning
to Fonseca, the señorita told him, an unusual
thing, but they had not stopped, and others had
passed later, going the opposite way.</p>

<p>She left the room and returned, dragging a small
sack of grain for the horses, which Bart had asked
her to procure, and there was a package of food
for Elbert’s need of to-morrow—all this spoken
of with frequent gestures toward the wounded
man in the little room; her every thought and
sentence apparently blent with something Bart
had said or wished. Yes, he would live, she
repeated, but his recovery would take many days.
Then Elbert heard his own words in careful
Spanish of the book:</p>

<p>‘Tell him I shall be waiting—that I will come
again to-morrow night or the next night—that I
shall wait for him until he is ready to travel—’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>‘You mean to leave now—at once?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I see that he is being well taken care of.
The horses might call to any horses traveling
by—’</p>

<p>His words were getting slower and quieter, but
there was in his body and brain an intolerable
burden having to do with the thought of to-morrow—not
only to-morrow, but ‘many days.’
It had been all he could do to live through to-day.
Now he left her, knowing she would steal back
to the little room at once. He crossed the inner
garden, the room of the harp, nodding to the
elders, crossed the yard, passed out through the
dobe gate—in unbroken darkness, moving toward
the alders of the creek-bed.</p>

<p>His feet dragged; the early night, so dark that
he had to keep constant thought to the road, burdened
by the sack of grain over his shoulder. Still
distant from the alders, he began to listen for
Mamie’s signal, but the sound of trotting hoofs
came instead.</p>

<p>One horse only, coming his way, no accompaniment
of wheels. He let down the grain-bag at
the side of the road, instinctively aware that if
either of his horses had pulled loose a hunch like
this on his shoulder would make any effort at
capture practically impossible in the dark.</p>

<p>‘Hoo-ooo, baby, easy, little one!’ he softly intoned.
He could see no movement yet; the hoofs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>were still. Then like an explosion, a snorting
blast of fright from the horse ahead—not Mamie.
He well knew her protest of fear. ‘Come in,
kid—easy, old-timer!’ from his lips, as he moved
forward very slowly, his fingers closing at last
upon the broken bridle-rein of the sorrel.</p>

<p>The big runner was standing almost rigidly in
the dark, as Elbert made a quick tie of the two
shortened leather ends, his ears still straining for a
sound from the mare. He mounted, but had difficulty
in turning back toward the alders. The gelding
fought the bit, tossing his head. The man’s
unspurred heel knocked his ribs, but the runner
snorted like a crazed colt at this, standing straight
up, and Bart’s warning about the spur flashed
back. Elbert, getting control again, snatched off
a small branch as he brushed the foliage at the
road-side, and the sorrel started forward at a
stiff-legged, unwilling trot, still unruly as he
neared the alders.</p>

<p>The mare was gone. Holding to the shortened
bridle-rein, Elbert was on his knees, lighting
matches—an ashen smile on his lips. Yes, he
actually smiled at himself now—so miserably
hopeless a few minutes before, just at the thought
of waiting days. Something to be dismal about
now.</p>

<p>Countless horse-tracks among the alders, conveying
nothing to his eyes. Passing rurales had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>possibly heard the horses, and tried to take them.
Possibly one of the police had mounted the sorrel
and attempted to force him with a spur.
That might account for old Mallet-head breaking
loose.</p>

<p>Elbert rode slowly on toward Fonseca, head
bowed. Yes, they had given him something to
be dismal about all right. What hope—if they
had taken her into town.</p>

<p>He couldn’t brace into Fonseca and attack the
town single-handed. Still he kept on, until—it
was almost a sob that surged up in his throat—the
sound of a nicker—far to the right! His
hand darted forward to the muzzle of the sorrel
to shut off possible answer. No need of that. The
big gelding was unconcerned about that far-off
sound.</p>

<p>Mamie—letting him know! He could tell that
call of hers in the midst of a herd of horses; and
the rurales or whoever had her, were not pushing
on to Fonseca, but eastward toward the mountains.
‘I’m coming!’ he muttered. He flicked
his branch on the sorrel’s flanks.</p>

<p>Minutes afterward, the call again; and presently
from over the eastern mountains, appeared
the moon, a shaving less full than last
night.</p>

<p>Last night—that moon from the cell of Arecibo—far-off
as childhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>Two hours, at least, of fierce strain—following
those whom he supposed were looking for
him; finally a faint haze of firelight over the rim
of a hill just ahead—the mysterious party having
come to a halt. If they were rurales, why
hadn’t they gone to Fonseca—why this halt in
the open? He was close as he dared to be with
the sorrel. Even now, the big stake-horse might
undertake to announce his presence and need of
forage. Elbert turned him back to a live-oak
scrub, made him fast, and retraced his way up
the slope again, struggling with weariness and
many fears. The moon was now well clear of the
eastern ridges.</p>

<p>On top, he gradually discerned two figures
stretched out in the firelight below—in ordinary
Mexican garb, not in uniform of rurales. Moving
nearer, he presently made out Mamie, still saddled,
a third Mexican sitting on the ground at
her head. Seconds crawled by, as he waited
breathlessly, with a vague hope that this third
one might doze, but nothing of the kind. Instead,
the Mexican now rose, leading his charge
to a low tree clump, where other horses were
faintly to be discerned.</p>

<p>Evidently the Mexican was about to fasten
the mare. Once tied, there was less chance for
her to break clear, than from the Mexican’s
hand. Only a second or two to think in; in fact,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>Elbert didn’t think it out. His fingers reached
for the handle of the sheath-knife, bringing the
whistle to his lips. Its shrill scream cut forth.
Mamie’s head lifted and yanked back, but the
Mexican did not lose his grip upon the rein.
Running forward Elbert whistled again; then
stretched his lungs in a yell, as strange and startling
to himself as to the sleepy Sonora hills.</p>

<p>The knife in his hand was not to kill; he had
merely not put it back in its sheath. The two
men by the fire were on their feet; the third stubbornly
trying to gain the saddle, but Mamie slid
from under, and kept pulling away. Then an
instant of utter amazement—the face of Mamie’s
tormentor near enough to be recognized—one
of Bart’s bandits whom he had raced away from
the night before.</p>

<p>Elbert changed the quality of his shouting,
but the Mexican had let go the bridle-rein, and
was speeding after his two companions, who had
vanished from the circle of firelight. They were
at their horses—mounting and spurring away.
Elbert rubbed his dazed eyes—they were gone—Mamie
trotting toward him, head extra high
to keep from tripping on her bridle-reins.</p>

<p>The whistle had done it—and his shouts,
which must have sounded like a platoon closing
in, to the leaderless bandit party. The whistle
for Mamie, the yell—Elbert did not know how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>he had come to vent that, unless for his own courage.</p>

<p>Never before had he felt such a sense of belonging
anywhere, as when he folded over the Pitcairn
stock-saddle. Sitting straight did not suffice; he
seemed fallen to clinging to the neck of his mare.
Even a minute later, he would have forgotten
Bart’s sorrel, tied securely in the bristling live-oak
scrub, had not Mamie flirted her signal as she
galloped by on the moon-drenched hill.</p>

<p>‘They sure thought I was the rurales,’ he
laughed.</p>

<p>At this juncture he missed his saddle-bags.</p>

<p>‘I suppose Bart would go back and get them
right now,’ he thought. ‘Not for me. Nothing
in them I can’t do without. What silver there is—those
three fellows I ditched last night—may
need that!’</p>

<p>His eyes were craning about the sky to locate
the north star.</p>

<p>‘I won’t have to tell Bart how I lost Mamie,
nor about the other three,’ he communed later.
‘Now that I’ve got her back, I won’t have to
speak of it at all.’</p>

<p>It was a different matter about that grain-sack,
however. The horses would need that, and
another drink from the creek to-night, before
facing to-morrow in the brown and sultry hills.
He made the big circle to the Fonseca road and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>the alders, but was back in a star-rimmed mountain
wilderness two hours before daybreak, the
big gelding taking an occasional nip at the grain-bag
as he trotted along.</p>

<h2 id="XXV">XXV<br><br>
ELBERT LEARNS TO WAIT</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Next</span> day Elbert climbed the foothills and explored
the mountains eastward. He found many
tracks of water, stream-beds of the rainy season,
but it was now autumn, the dryest time of the
year, and hours passed before he followed a trickle
up a dim ravine to its first pool. He had to grant
that it was the horses that helped him locate the
water in the first place, but there was queer satisfaction
about the experience, as if he had been
marooned on an island and his life depended.
No water ever tasted just like that. He watched
the horses drink and graze, and made them stand
for a half hour at a time in the sludgy grass at
the side of the stream, while he stared up from
the shadowed cañon to where the sunlight burned
on the ridges. ‘Only one thing better than water
for a horse’s hoofs,’ old Bob Leadley had said,
‘and that’s more water.’</p>

<p>No further need to cross the Fonseca road
night and morning to reach the creek. He would
risk a night-call at El Relicario once in a while—grub
for himself and forage for the horses, but
the old ruin was now fifteen, possibly eighteen
miles, and Bart was in good hands.... One by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>one, Elbert beat back the days, though he actually
lost count, even before it became apparent
that Bart Leadley was going to live. During his
first two or three calls at the ranch house, there
was a good deal of doubt on this main point.
From the very beginning, the big fellow weakly
pressed him not to stay.</p>

<p>‘No use of you hangin’ up all these days in the
mountains, Doc,’ he said. ‘I’ll follow north across
the Border, as soon as I can make a break.’</p>

<p>‘But I’m getting to like it out there,’ Elbert
would tell him. ‘Only lonesome a little at first.
Why, there’s no place I could leave the sorrel for
you, if I went. The rurales would know that
horse anywhere.’</p>

<p>‘Take him along. I’ll get a cayuse, somewhere—’</p>

<p>‘No, Bart, I came down here for you. That’s
what your father wanted—for me to bring you
back—’</p>

<p>The other’s eyes held the low ceiling. ‘I’d hate
to have you <i>after</i> me,’ he laughed. ‘I mean like
a sheriff—’</p>

<p>Elbert conned this all next day in his high solitude.
He couldn’t get it quite clear. Surely, no
sheriff would ever suffer from hopeless spells of
faint-heartedness such as he was given to....
They were oddly embarrassed with each other in
those first talks, but when silence became oppressive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
Bart would enquire regarding some detail
concerning the horses. On this one subject alone,
Elbert expatiated.</p>

<p>‘A little grain from here is keeping them fit,’
he would report in effect. ‘And say, your Mallet-head
sure has an appetite,’ he once observed.
‘Mountains agree with him. He flavors up his
forage with all sorts of new leaves—even pine
needles. Mamie’s more particular.’</p>

<p>Elbert caught a gleam from the cot. Bart’s
black eyes were holding him. ‘You like ’em,
don’t you?’</p>

<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>‘Horses.’</p>

<p>‘Sure,’ said Elbert.</p>

<p>‘I knew—the minute you climbed on that
mare in front of the quarters in Arecibo. We
were a bit in a hurry right then, but you didn’t
jerk her round. I got to know pretty well before
daylight that you were a real hand with a horse,
Mister.’</p>

<p>So Bart was really fooled. He had said something
of this kind before, that first daybreak here
in El Relicario, but Elbert had feared then that
his mind was wandering. He didn’t answer
now.</p>

<p>‘I like these people,’ Bart was saying, about
the Mexicans. ‘I get along with ’em pretty well,
but they don’t savvy the horse. It doesn’t seem
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>to run in the blood. Monte Vallejo who had all
Sonora thinking he was a caballero—even to
Monte, a horse was something to ride to death.
All these people saw and hack and ride on the
bit. That’s what got us into trouble with those
race-horses, and that’s what got to me from
you, the first minute in front of el cuartel—to
see a white man sitting a horse and knowing
what he was doing and what her mouth was
made of.’</p>

<p>‘Your father told me all about Mamie,’ Elbert
said.</p>

<p>‘All the telling in the world wouldn’t do it,
if a man didn’t have the feel of a bridle-rein on
his own hook.’</p>

<p>It was like being called to the carpet to be presented
with a diploma or a medal—no time for
Elbert to trust his voice to relate that Mamie was
practically his first experience, and that only a
few months ago.</p>

<p>‘How was it that the race-horses got you into
trouble?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘We couldn’t manage ’em. They were used to
being babied for the track—used to the sprint;
didn’t know anything about saving themselves
for distance-running. There was a lot of young
stuff among them, and all our old cayuses were
done for. We tried hammering the bang-tails to
the road, and they went crazy.... I drew the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>prize of the lot. All old Mallet-head knows is to
eat and run—so long as you keep the spur off
him!’</p>

<p>‘He keeps his feelings to himself, so they can’t
be hurt. He’s sure rugged,’ said Elbert.</p>

<p>Sometimes Bart seemed to be listening for a
step as they talked; and when the señorita appeared
in the doorway, Bart’s eyes and hers
would meet and cling for a second.</p>

<p>There began to be a secret heaviness connected
with this for Elbert. What would happen to her
when Bart left the little room of the cross and the
white flower?... So much taller she seemed,
than in that first moment in the dobe gateway.
Had he seen her then as now, he might not have
asked her help. Perhaps, even if he had not
heard the song of the corn-dust maiden, he could
never have thought of imposing as he did that
morning upon Valencia Vidaña, the daughter of
El Relicario, now a dobe ruin of many rooms, but
in its day one of the famous ranch-houses of
Sonora.</p>

<p>‘Great name in these parts in the old days,’
Bart once whispered. ‘Valencia’s father was one
of the big men of Sonora under Diaz, but everything’s
broken down since. Loot and confiscation’s
the trick here—worst of all from Juan
Cordano. We happened in the right house. The
old don told me the other morning, he had hoped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>to see Monte Vallejo in Cordano’s place here in
Sonora.’</p>

<p>Long talks concerning all that led to Elbert’s
coming to Sonora. Bart’s deep laugh once
sounded in the little room.</p>

<p>‘I’m used to Mexicans,’ he said. ‘I don’t know
much about the States. I s’pose there are a lot
of people up there you can trust offhand, like
Dad trusted you.’</p>

<p>‘You see, he had to have somebody interested
in Sonora, and willing to do a lot of riding,’ Elbert
answered. ‘You know, he wanted you to have
Mamie, but he wasn’t sure how long it would
take me to find you—a chance even, that I
might not. He didn’t want her to change hands
another time. He always thought about her
feelings—’</p>

<p>Elbert found himself staring at the little crucifix
as he talked. Bart didn’t seem to be troubled
as much as he was—about the feelings of the
one in this house.... One night after about ten
days in El Relicario, Bart turned over and drew
his right shoulder clear from its covering to show
how the wound was healing.</p>

<p>Elbert cleared his throat. ‘I don’t see how you
stayed in the saddle from that bridge until daybreak
when we got here,’ he said hoarsely. ‘Why,
that bullet would have knocked me out of the
saddle like—like—’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>He had quite forgotten—‘clear through to
Nogales.’</p>

<p>A low laugh again. ‘Say, amigo mio—say,
Mister, you’re sure nervous as a filly, about being
caught makin’ a move like a gamester!’</p>

<p>Elbert conned that all the next day in the hills.</p>

<h2 id="XXVI">XXVI<br><br>
SILENCE</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> he was learning undreamed-of-matters
about himself. No amount of riding such as
he had done down in the valleys could have shown
him what he was getting now, in the stillness and
sunlight and starlight of high country. A hundred
times a day, the flick of a lizard over leaf or pebble
or twig called his eye; that was the only continual
distraction. The days were mainly silent,
though the nights were full of sound; the coyotes
sometimes a maddening chorus that stirred up
unheard-of deeps in the listener, and once as he
lay awake at night a muffle-winged owl swept
past so close as to fan his face. That shook him
like the sounds during his first night out in White
Stone Flats. In the stillness, thoughts rose up in
him with a power he hadn’t known before; one
could get so accustomed to this sort of life, he
reflected, that he would be entirely unfit in a
little while for the towns again.</p>

<p>Here’s where a man reverted to type. What
he was at bottom came out. One might sink into
being just an animal—eating and drinking and
sleeping—or get more fiery alive with the days,
more quick and sensitive with strange inner activity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
There were times when Elbert’s thoughts
carried him along with a clear cool strength that
was almost frightening. He knew now that he had
never been alone before; that a man isn’t quite
alone, even if locked in his own room—that he
is only really alone with the sky above and the
earth beneath.</p>

<p>He had told Bart that he was getting to like it,
but that didn’t become wholly true until quite a
number of days had passed. Again and again he
felt his jaw hardening, his lips pressed together;
gradually his fears fell away and the silence bit
into the very center of his being. He became a
part of the outer silence of the days, a part of
the fierce still sunlight that slowly blackened his
hands and face. He looked back upon his dreams
in the room at home, remembering the things he
had treasured there—Indian blankets, pictures,
leather work—all had meant something.</p>

<p>Out of these kid treasures and symbols, Cal
and Slim had come to life, Heaslep’s, Nacimiento,
San Pasquali; Bob Leadley, Bismo on the Rio
Brava, Red Ante, the Dry Cache mine; Sonora,
the cells, the corner of the wall, flight from the
rurales, El Relicario. He could shut his eyes and
think way back to the very beginning—hear
the swish of motor cars from his bedroom window,
the sound of the piano below, the sounds of his
phonograph, and that last swung him swiftly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>across the continent to the Plaza at Los Angeles—‘Cuando
sali—’ and the leather-store.</p>

<p>All these a part of him now, but in the beginning
there had only been a little room of books
and pictures and yearnings—yearnings that
finally drove him out to find his Crimson Foam.
Something else he had found—that still room
in Tucson. Not a symbol of that in his father’s
house—oh, yes, of course, the alabaster bowl in
the dining-room!</p>

<p>His thin lips stretched into the beginnings of a
smile. He had heard it said that each day brings
to a man nine parts review and one part advance
work. Everything seemed like review to him
now—the whole circle rounded (at least, it would
be when Bart and he were safely over the Border
into the States) everything review, except that
still room in Tucson. Very much advance work,
that. His heart pumped so that he could actually
hear its beat.</p>

<p>Sometimes he felt, if he could get a little deeper
into the silence, he would know all about—even
that. Anyway, it began to dawn on him that
everything would have been spoiled if he had
rushed north alone, leaving Bart—that the greatest
adventure of all lay right in the core of these
days of solitude and silence. One night he felt
like a different man altogether, as he started
down toward El Relicario in the dusk.</p>

WORDS</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent">‘<span class="smcap">You</span> see, I was lazy—no two ways about it—lazy,
from the very beginning,’ Bart said during
one of the night-talks. ‘I can see how Dad felt
now. I didn’t know any better than to think he
was against me in those days. I got the feeling I
was wronged, and that’s bad. It’s bad to let that
wronged feeling pile up in a kid’s chest, until
there is no seeing it any other way. The thing
that hurt me most was about that horse—old
Rat-tail from the Cup Q.’</p>

<p>Elbert kept still with effort. He knew the story
of the rat-tail from Bob Leadley’s telling, almost
as well as Bart did, but the latter got to talking
too rarely to be interrupted.</p>

<p>‘A bad name, that horse had, but he wasn’t
really bad. A horse isn’t like a man; he isn’t like
a dog. A horse is more like a woman—he goes
by feeling, not by his head. A dog will dope a
thing out; a mule will, but a horse feels his way.
Why, that mare of yours—I’ll bet she doesn’t
miss much that’s goin’ on, even if her back’s
turned. You’re not foolin’ her a lot, even if you
think you are. She’s cute as a woman—</p>

<p>‘The more a man knows about a horse, the
more he respects him, the more careful he is,’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>Bart went on. ‘You never see a real hand yank
his horse around or flourish none. You’re apt not
to know a real ridin’ gent unless you’re one yourself.
He works easy, and doesn’t attract the eye.
You never see him starting a horse into a run as
soon as he leaves the corral—unless there’s
mighty pressin’ business, like that night we first
got together. You don’t see him rowel or quirt,
because a real hand doesn’t bring up a horse to
need stimulants that way. And he isn’t botherin’
with one that does—not for long. Nine times
out of ten a bad horse is man-spoiled, and a real
hand doesn’t care to mix with other men’s botched
jobs.’</p>

<p>Elbert couldn’t help but see Cal Monroid in all
this—Cal, and the way he handled and sat old
Chester. Bart and Cal were curiously alike in
the one utterly cool and nerveless quality. Evidently
it was in this quality, first of all, that their
mastery over horses lay—no nerves to confuse
the feelings of a mount.</p>

<p>‘That old gray had been raked and hooked so
long that all he knew was to fight back. Everybody
over at the rancho was afraid of him. Of
course, the fellows didn’t say they were; they’re
more afraid of each other finding out that they’re
afraid, than they are of what they’re afraid of—’</p>

<p>‘I can see that,’ said Elbert.</p>

<p>A curious look came into Bart’s eyes—a trace
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>of deep rest. ‘You see, a horse knows when a
man’s afraid. He smells fear, or feels it. He gets
afraid, too, or confused—loses what little head
he’s got. He begins to look out through a sheet of
blood, if you drive him deeper into fear. If pushed
far, he goes crazy, and that’s what they call a bad
horse. Sometimes they are ten times as strong as
a horse in his right senses—just like a man-maniac—’</p>

<p>Elbert had so much to say it was hard to keep
still.</p>

<p>‘You see, I wanted that old gray so badly for
my own,’ Bart went on. ‘They told me how bad
he was, but I couldn’t believe it. He let me get
up to him—let me climb on his back. But when
I got him back to Bismo, everybody remembered
him bein’ an outlaw. Dad tried breakin’ him
again—and they took him back to the Cup Q.’</p>

<p>Bart chuckled. One would think he had been
telling some amusing boyhood experience. His
voice was easy, almost careless—Bob Leadley
all over again—not a sign for the listener that a
deep misery of life was being discussed. Suddenly
Elbert realized that it was not only with horses,
but with men like Bob Leadley and his son—one
had to trust his feelings, or else miss a lot.
And with women—</p>

<p>‘But your father knew better afterward,’ Elbert
finally said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>‘How’s that?’</p>

<p>‘He knew you had something on the rat-tail,
he didn’t have—’</p>

<p>‘How’s that?’</p>

<p>‘He told me. Everybody in Bismo kept warning
him that the gray would kill you. He got
afraid <i>for you</i>, but he knew better afterward.
Your father came to understand what you meant
about not wanting a ‘broke’ horse. He told me
he thought about that one thing for years. It was
from him and some things from Mort Cotton—that
I got any idea about handling Mamie—’
Deep relief, Elbert knew as he halted a moment,
the same that he had known that night, as they
rode away from el cuartel in Arecibo. He was
making it all clear at last. He got a queer feeling,
as if Bob Leadley were resting easier, too.</p>

<p>‘One of the squarest men anywhere, your
father,’ he went on. ‘He knew you had something
on Rat-tail that he didn’t. He knew that
“breaking” a horse is old stuff. He said he had
belonged to the old school that thinks a horse is
ruined if it ever gets its own way. One of the
things he liked to say best was that there are a
whole lot of good riders, but only once in a long
while a good horseman—’</p>

<p>‘But he didn’t understand about Palto.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, Bart. Even Mort Cotton did.’</p>

<p>‘They didn’t think I did right, did they?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Elbert.</p>

<p>‘Foolin’, aren’t you, amigo mio?’</p>

<p>‘Not on your life! He and Mort Cotton were
crazy-tired, all shot to pieces—that night in
Red Ante. Of course, Letchie Welton only had
his idea of law. Why, your father thought it out
for years, never got over it—his part—or rather,
what he didn’t do. Kept saying at the last that a
man can’t “wash his hands.”’</p>

<p>‘Took it hard?’</p>

<p>‘Rather, but he understood it all at the last.
Mort Cotton did, too. It was Mort who said at
the hearing back in Bismo—that the most
merciful shot he ever heard fired was yours that
night before you rode out of Red Ante.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sorry Dad took it so hard.... You see—you
see, I couldn’t get Palto loose. He might
have lived for days—until they got him to a
place where they could string him up—’</p>

<p>The next day alone in the mountains, Elbert
found that the old story of Red Ante was slipping
out from him—that it didn’t hurt any
more, that it would be difficult, and likely unnecessary,
ever to talk about it again.</p>

‘LIKE THE VIRGIN SPEAKING—’</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Finally</span> came the night when Bart said he
would be ready to ride within a week, but just
then they heard a light step in the next room,
and Elbert’s voice became very hushed.</p>

<p>‘I’ve been looking for a way north through the
mountains. My idea is to take it easy, riding
nights—keeping our eyes on—’</p>

<p>‘On what?’ Bart asked.</p>

<p>‘On the north star,’ in embarrassed tone.</p>

<p>‘Why, we’re not thirty miles from the Border
right now. We can do it in a night.’</p>

<p>‘But I’ve been thinking we’d better not enter
Arizona on any of the regular roads—and there’s
quite a ride west after that—’</p>

<p>Señorita Valencia was in the doorway.</p>

<p>‘You’re the doctor!’ Bart laughed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Two nights later Elbert made Mamie fast in an
old lane about three hundred yards from the
Fonseca road directly back of El Relicario. This
was his next to last trip from the mountains down,
according to the plan. He was to bring both
horses next time, two or three nights later. Then
north and west with Bart through the high range,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>which he had explored so many days with the one
single thought of ending his mission.</p>

<p>Nearing the old ranch house, he moved around
in front to approach by the road, but heard Mexican
voices before reaching the gateway. Stealing
closer he saw three ponies standing just within—carbine-boots
and saber-sheathes! Only the rurales
carried that outfit. He moved back and
circled among the scented vine-tangles of the
grounds, at length drawing near an unglazed
window of an empty room, which was just across
a corridor from the little room where Bart lay.
Faint reflection of the candle-light came from
there, careless strumming of a guitar and laughter
of the Mexicans from the front of the
house.</p>

<p>A light step at his left, a movement of white,
visible as he turned—Valencia, alone in the
grounds. Softly he called her name.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I prayed you would come, Señor! The
rurales are here. They have seen him! I have
left them but a moment—saying I must dress—’
She was all in white, her face held close to his,
the breath of her whispering part of the perfume
of the dark.</p>

<p>‘You must take him away to-night—now,
while they wait—or he will have to go with
them! You see, they are not quite sure yet, it is
he, but have sent for others in Fonseca who will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>know. Before the others come, while I keep the
ones here in the front of the house—you must
take him to the mountains—to your country!’</p>

<p>‘Have they got Bart in front with them?’</p>

<p>‘No, he’s still lying in there—but one of the
men is watching in the corridor. I have told them
how ill he is!’</p>

<p>Elbert spoke swiftly: ‘I’ll go and bring the
mare closer in, Señorita, and be back to this window
in ten minutes. Get word to Bart that I’m
coming back!’</p>

<p>‘I will try—or perhaps my mother. They are
waiting for me in there now. I must keep them
in the front!’</p>

<p>He heard the Mexican voices. ‘In ten minutes—’
he hastily whispered.</p>

<p>He was running back toward Mamie’s tether.
No moon, but a few great stars, fireflies in a near
low tree—a perfumed, humid night. Thoughts
ran with him. It was like the mystery of life—her
pale upheld face in the dark, with an untellable
meaning for his heart, having to do with a
corn-dust maiden. Even as he ran, he marveled
that she could help him get Bart away ‘to the
mountains, to your country!’ ... the breath of
her whispering—</p>

<p>Mamie was dancing, as his hands ran over the
cinches. ‘The job of our lives!’ he panted.
‘You’re fit, little one. Won’t be your fault if we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>don’t make it! It’s for him—for old Bob Leadley,
Mamie!’</p>

<p>He was riding back. He could not bring the
mare too near to the ranch house, lest she signal
to the rurales’ horses standing in front. He
reached the unglazed window of the unused room.
Perhaps she had been unable to get Bart word,
for he had not come. Perhaps, the full ten minutes
had not passed.</p>

<p>He waited a moment, then climbed into the
empty room, crossing softly toward the faint
sheen of light in the corridor. Reaching the door,
he could look across the corridor into the little
room where a single candle burned. Only the
foot of Bart’s cot was visible.</p>

<p>Now a step sounded down the corridor at his
left. He drew back into the dark. A Mexican
approached, glanced into the little room, then
turned back toward the patio—the rurale pacing
his post.</p>

<p>Elbert craned forward as far as he dared; this
time he saw the covering of the cot flung back,
a single booted leg beneath. Something familiar
in the way it jerked that second, made him know
that Bart was drawing a boot on the other leg.
How could he let Bart know he had come? The
slightest whisper was as impossible as it was for
him to cross the corridor while the sentry moved
back and forth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>
<p>At this instant a liquid shower of chords
sounded through the house—the great harp in
the front room coming to life—Valencia’s voice
lifting above her accompaniment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Cuando sali de la Habana,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Valgame Dios!’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A heart-break in itself—that song.</p>

<p>At the same time, another voice from the patio—quavery
tones of the old señora offering the
sentry a glass of wine. Was she trying to hold
him at the far end of his post? Now in the opposite
doorway, tipping a little weakly, hatless,
without coat, but fully booted, Bart Leadley
showed himself, a cool laugh on the dark face.
Elbert darting a glance down the corridor, saw
the back of the rurale’s head. He thrust out his
hand to steady Bart across the corridor.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘... Era la que me miraba</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Diciendo adios—’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They had crossed the empty room; Elbert outside
the window, was helping Bart through—the
rurale still held to the patio-end of the corridor
by the señora—or was it by the song? Even
in the fierce drum of his excitement, words of old
Bob Leadley flashed to Elbert’s mind: ‘... like
the Virgin speaking to them.’ Yes, he could
understand being held by that song; a wonder
above everything, that Bart could leave at all.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">‘Qui es mir persona</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cuentale tus amores—’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They had crossed the grounds to Mamie’s
tether; Bart’s left ankle was in his hand for a lift.
He swung up behind on the spacious saddle-tree;
Mamie darting off in the dark toward high country
with her double burden. Hauntingly from
behind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">‘Me la han matado</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Me la han matado—’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And from Bart:</p>

<p>‘That there song, Mister, has followed me all
the way!’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Miles back among the hills, they picked up the
sorrel; still no sound of pursuit. Then it was
northward among the foothills—the north star
for Elbert’s eyes. At any moment he half expected
to hear, ‘No, I’m not going to fall, Mister,’ but
to-night it was: ‘Don’t worry about me. I’m
sittin’ easy.’</p>

<p>Before daybreak they followed a little stream
up higher—less volume but more noise all the
way, and came to rest in the deep privacy of a
sunless ravine.</p>

<p>The second night, long after midnight, they
heard the far scream of a train from the north.</p>

<p>‘The Mexican Pacific,’ suggested Elbert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>‘Where?’ said Bart.</p>

<p>‘That train—’</p>

<p>‘The Mexican Pacific cuts north through San
Isidro Gorge ten miles southeast of here. Ask
old Mallet-head, that’s where we dragged him
out of his Pullman—’</p>

<p>‘You think we’ve crossed the Border—that
this is a U.S. Transcontinental?’</p>

<p>‘The States is a large place, but I sure thought
you’d know home when you got there, Doc.’</p>

<p>But Elbert could hardly believe. A little later
they caught a glimpse of the crawling serpent of
coaches, faint lights for scales. Finally in the
first daylight the two horses crossed the tracks—‘Safety
First,’ authoritative like an Eleventh
Commandment on a big water tank in the dusk
of morning.</p>

HIGH COUNTRY</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">They</span> found the highway north of the railroad
and turned their horses west.</p>

<p>Bart looked a bit white and shaky but made
no sign to stop.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think we’d better lay up for a day
or two in one of these towns, so you can rest,
Bart?’ Elbert asked.</p>

<p>‘I’m not sleepy,’ said the other. ‘I’m gettin’
what I need outdoors, and aboard old Mallet-head.
I always did need the outside of a horse to
pull myself together.’</p>

<p>As it began to get hot in the morning, they
veered into the hills and found shade, resting
several hours.</p>

<p>‘How far west of Nogales do you think we are
right now?’ Elbert asked.</p>

<p>‘About a hundred miles, I’d say. You see
Fonseca lay a long ways west of the main road
south from Nogales, and we’ve kept pushin’ west
through the mountains since then. We can find
out by askin’ along the railroad—’</p>

<p>‘I’m figurin’ we might not have to go to San
Forenso first to get to the cabin,’ Elbert said.
‘You see, San Forenso is still farther west from
here than your father’s mine—’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>All through the recent weeks in Mexico, Elbert
had felt his mission would end when he safely
crossed the Border with Bart, but now he knew
a secret restless urge actually to reach the cabin,
before letting even Mort Cotton know.</p>

<p>‘You see, everything we need is there,’ he
added.</p>

<p>‘Lead the way, Doc.’</p>

<p>The second morning afterward, Elbert looked
up into a range of hills, remarking that he thought
the Dry Cache was up there. ‘San Forenso is
twenty miles ahead, and we’d have to circle
back, if we went there. The mine must be straight
up from here. Yes, I think those are our mountains,
all right,’ he added. ‘I remember your
father said you could look over into California
and back into Sonora from just above the mine—’</p>

<p>‘It’s giddap with me. Persuade yourself—’</p>

<p>But the mountains that had looked so feasible
from the railroad turned sinister and rebellious as
they climbed. Forty miles around would have
been simple to the twenty they had made before
sundown that day—a waterless fight all the way.
They were in the big timber of the altitudes again
in the lengthening shadows, and Elbert looked at
the man beside him, riding on hard gray nerve;
then at the drooping head of his own mare in
front. He had given in to a sort of mania to get
into high country. It had been getting clearer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>for hours that he should have gone straight to
San Forenso, from where he could have been sure
of his way to the claim. It might be best to turn
back to the railroad now—while there was a bit
of light.... Just at this instant Mamie’s ears
pricked; her body came to life under the saddle.
The sullen eye of the gelding caught a flash of her
new fire.</p>

<p>She broke into a trot, starting down-grade.
They crossed a sloping bench of big timber and
checked down into a valley open to the western
light.</p>

<p>‘I don’t see any trail, but she’s sure got an
idea!’ Elbert called.</p>

<p>‘She sure has,’ Bart panted, ‘and I’m for it—’</p>

<p>In the open, she veered swiftly to the left, making
for a cañon mouth, and then in letters writhing
a little before Elbert’s dazed eyes: ‘Are You
Doomed?’ on its white rock! The living fact of
the Flats broke upon him.</p>

<p>‘Why, we’re home, Bart!’ he gasped. ‘The
cabin’s back a ways. She’s makin’ for the last
water—’</p>

<p>‘First water I’ve seen in some time,’ came from
the other, as Elbert helped him down.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There was dusk and wood-smoke; the grinding
of the coffee-mill, the sputter of bacon oil for flapjacks,
a deadlock on the matter of whether a can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>of Michigan pears should be opened or Hawaiian
pineapple—finally both, for it was a fiesta night
at the Dry Cache mine, and the stores were endless.
They had fared slim for some days and ridden
hard. Few words, because Elbert felt a bulge
in his throat from the pressure of unfamiliar joys.
After supper, he left Bart and led the two horses,
in their ‘cooling’ blankets, down to the last water
to finish their deep drink for the night, also to
refill canteens. Bart came out of the cabin, as he
returned, and they sat down in the clean straw
when grain was fed, leaning their backs against
the fence.</p>

<p>That astonishing sense of unity crept over
Elbert that he had known once or twice before.
He remembered Bob Leadley’s story of when he
was a little chap, leaving the supper table where
there was a fight on between his father and
mother, and going out into the barnyard where
the cattle ruminated, and there was peace. Yes,
he must have listened deeply to all Bob Leadley’s
words. It was almost as if he had been that little
boy; almost as familiar to him as that night of
tequila in Cienaga, in his own experience, when
he had sat with Cal and Slim (Chester and the
Indian and Mamie grinding at their sun-parched
corn). A warm breeze fanned his face now with a
smell of sunlit rocks and pine bark and that carried
him back to the night of that warm wind at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>Heaslep’s ranch, when Cal and Slim asked him
to join them in a ride south, where he was going
anyway. Exquisite ease in the very fatigue that
closed in, delight of relaxation complete for the
first time in his life.</p>

<p>The next day they didn’t stir far from the
claim, only moving about the different patches
of sun and shade to stretch out in the deep
languor that followed days of strain.</p>

<p>‘Pretty near everything a man could want
here—don’t you think?’ said Bart.</p>

<p>‘Pretty near,’ said Elbert.</p>

<p>‘The old man made it all to suit himself,
didn’t he?’ the voice drawled on. ‘Always a
great hand for keeping things up, Dad was.
Left his mark on everything. I can see it now.
A kid wouldn’t—’</p>

<p>‘I think he was making it for you all the time,’
Elbert said, ‘just as if he was writing a letter to
you, when he built those cabinets and stored
them. I know he was—always thinking you
would come back like this.’</p>

<p>‘A lot of work in that tunnel for one man to do
alone,’ said Bart. ‘Must have taken him a
year—’</p>

<p>‘More,’ said Elbert.</p>

<p>The next morning at breakfast a curious quiet
settled between the two men. The spell was
breaking, a different gleam in the eyes of the big
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>fellow across the table. In a wordless fashion,
Elbert sat for a time. Another sentence of old
Bob Leadley’s cleared with deep meaning. ‘I’d
get lonesome for him when he was right in the
same room—’</p>

<p>‘We’d better not wait any longer before letting
Mort Cotton know,’ Elbert finally said. ‘I’ll
ride down to the Slim Stake and get him on the
telephone—’</p>

<p>He was back within four hours and Mort
reached the claim before sundown. It took two
days for everything to be settled, and Elbert was
tired in an altogether different way at the end.
He had done more talking in those two days
than in all the weeks in Sonora.</p>

<p>‘Bart,’ he said, when they were finally alone
once more, ‘there’s nothing I’d like better than
to work that gold tooth with you, but I’ll have to
be away for a few weeks.’</p>

<p>‘Which way you headin’, Doc?’</p>

<p>‘East. Been away from home for a long time.
I’ve got to see my father—’ Elbert caught that
strange gleam again in the eyes of the other.
‘And my sisters,’ he added.</p>

<p>‘I’m ridin’, too, Mister. For a while—’</p>

<p>‘You’re not going—you’re not going back?’</p>

<p>‘Back into Mexico?’ the other laughed.</p>

<p>‘I thought, perhaps—’</p>

<p>‘Why, you don’t seem to believe I like it here,’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>Bart chuckled. ‘Pretty near everything a man
could want—’</p>

<p>Just words, perhaps, Elbert thought. He didn’t
see how Bart could forget. He couldn’t have, if
he had been in Bart’s place.</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, I like to look and listen around here,’
the big fellow went on, ‘and back in that tunnel
there’s a message for you and me all right, but no
hurry, as you say. We’ll wait a little longer for
that. A whole lot of times down in Sonora I’ve
wondered just how it would feel to turn loose in
an American town—Tucson, for instance.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll be stopping off in Tucson,’ Elbert allowed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That day they rode down to San Forenso and
left the horses at Mort Cotton’s ranch. Elbert
planned to take the night train.</p>

<p>‘I’ll stay on with Mort for a day or so,’ Bart
said. ‘I might hunt you up in Tucson, if I get
there before you leave. They say there’s a hotel
there—’</p>

<p>‘The Santa Clara,’ said Elbert.</p>

<p>He looked back toward Mort’s corral, as the
old cattleman was bringing the rig to take him
to the station. He moved to the gate and let himself
in. Mamie walked toward him, but halted
with lifted head, in the afternoon light, as he had
seen her the first day, only now her coat was
faded by many sweats and suns. Her head lifted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>higher. She was listening for something no one
else could possibly hear—</p>

<p>‘One more listening mare,’ Elbert whispered.</p>

<p>Her forehead presently bumped his shoulder.
Farther off the sorrel stake-horse was sniffing at
the cracks in Mort’s hay-shed.</p>

<p>‘I’ll be coming back, Mamie. Oh, yes, I’ll be
coming back—’</p>

TUCSON AGAIN</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> wasn’t a dappled gray this time, but one of
the same breed. Elbert was abroad in the streets
of Tucson, long before the city was astir, his train
having set him down at an unseemly hour. He
passed a harness shop and peered in through the
window, where his eye encountered the cocked
ears and pointed head of a wooden horse. Evidently
its place was the sidewalk, daytimes, being
wheeled into the shop at closing-hour on castors.</p>

<p>It was as if he were in the Plaza at Los Angeles
again. It was more: like a man coming back to
find his old nursery unchanged. Elbert’s lips
moved.</p>

<p>‘Wouldn’t Mamie shy if she passed that palfrey
on a lonely road?’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>His hand pained. He was clutching the arm
of a rocking-chair. He had left a network of
invisible foot-tracks over two sections, at least,
of the city of Tucson. The day was now advanced
to eight-thirty in the morning, and he
was back in his room at the Santa Clara. His
strong, blackened fingers relaxed on the oak. He
arose and pulled down both outer windows. He
went to the hall-door to feel that it was locked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>He took off coat and vest, wiped the sweat from
his forehead, called a number at the telephone.</p>

<p>‘May I speak with Miss Gertling?’</p>

<p>‘Miss Gertling—why, she doesn’t live here
any more—’</p>

<p>‘Does she—where?’</p>

<p>‘She’s only here part of the day—some days—’</p>

<p>‘Could you give me her address?’</p>

<p>‘Who is it, please?’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Sartwell—’</p>

<p>‘Oh.’</p>

<p>‘Elbert Sartwell—’</p>

<p>‘Oh,—you’re—wait a moment, please!...
Yes, Mr. Sartwell, you may call—’ the snappy
tone had softened.</p>

<p>Elbert’s mind fumbled the number, but he got
it down.... His second call was entered. A
man’s tone advised him respectfully not to disconnect.
Then out of the smothering stillness:</p>

<p>‘Hello?’</p>

<p>‘Mary Gertling!’</p>

<p>‘Yes.... Oh, I know ... and where are you?’</p>

<p>‘At the Santa Clara.’</p>

<p>‘Will you come over?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, wait! I know better. I’ll come for <i>you</i>!
In the street in front of the hotel—in ten—fifteen
minutes.’</p>

<p>He bathed a third time. He was below watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
the street both ways. Crowds were passing,
by this time—on the way to work. Elbert’s feelings
were torturingly divided. Sometimes he
pitied all these people going to work; sometimes
he envied their calm matter-of-fact seizure of life.
As for himself, he seemed dangling in space,
having lost his clutch entirely.</p>

<p>The crowd jostled him back against the entrance.
It must be a half hour. Could there have
been a mistake? His eye verified the fact that
it was the Santa Clara hotel he was standing
against. Many faces coming from the right, as
many more from the left. He would hold his
eyes one way, until he felt she must be standing
at his back. Yet it was from neither right nor
left that her call came—from the throng of cars
in the street, a roadster pressing in toward the
curb. She was alone. She had opened the door.
Like that day in the flowered room, he had been
listening and watching toward the hall and she
had come from the porch.</p>

<p>‘I gave you a ring at the Finishing School,’
he said, as if he had been waiting months to say
just that.</p>

<p>‘I finished last June, but stayed on part-time
for other work there.’</p>

<p>‘Post-graduate work?’</p>

<p>‘I’ve been learning to ride a horse. I thought
you might come there first.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>Any one could see she had driven a car for a
long time—queer ease of her own, no thought.
She straightened her dress and thrust her wrap
back from her shoulders, as if ready for all day.
The small boot poured gas with mathematical
accuracy and steadiness.</p>

<p>They were out of heavy traffic now; passing
through an end of town increasingly familiar to
Elbert.</p>

<p>‘Everything has seemed tangled and lonesome
during this last week,’ she was saying. ‘But before
that, it all grew clearer and clearer.’</p>

<p>‘How do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘For three weeks, just before this last, everything
seemed to get clearer and clearer.’</p>

<p>‘Why, those were the weeks I spent in the
mountains,’ he said. ‘I was alone all the time,
and high up. It sure was a change coming down,
though. Last few days, it seemed my mind was
trying to make up something that never really
happened. Hardest of all, just before I got you
on the ’phone this morning.’</p>

<p>Yes, it was the Border Highway they were on.
She was at his left. Gradually he was breathing
better. At first he had thought she would have
to hurry back, but that thought was slipping
away. She wasn’t speeding, but pressed the car
forward steadily, as if making a day’s passage.
It was a white dress she had on, a sort of linen—like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
a handkerchief. The white road stretched
ahead, very straight, but gently rolling. The
sense of on and on came to him. He had always
felt like fighting when with a girl before—except
in that flowered room—but there wasn’t
a fight in the world to-day. The wide empty
road stretched ahead for miles; a film of dull
shining vapor gleamed over the top of each rise,
but always as they rolled up to it, the film vanished,
showing up presently above the next. They
never arrived, always approaching, as to a mirage.</p>

<p>‘Sometime we’ll get to know it down here on
the roads and even in the midst of the city,’ she
said.</p>

<p>‘You mean that sense of clearness—I spoke
of having in the mountains—?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, we must not lose it anywhere—as we
did last week. Why, I thought some of the time
you weren’t coming back—’</p>

<p>‘I thought some of the time, you weren’t expecting
me to come back,’ he said with a shiver.</p>

<p>They were running through Harrisburg of trucking
days. Evidently she had no mind to return—Heaslep’s
beyond. It would break in upon their
day to stop, yet she had chosen the way. He
couldn’t tell her to go back. He had wanted to
see Cal and Slim, but not to-day. Still, she kept
on, the ranch-houses finally showing ahead.</p>

<p>‘I know ’em there—we’ll have to call, since
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>we’re going by. That’s where Cal and Slim are.
At least—’</p>

<p>‘Shall I turn in?’ she asked strangely.</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>He saw the faces jerking out from the farrier’s
and the cook-house, one or two Chinese. Elbert
nodded and gestured, but not an eye turned to
him, all cooling upon the one at his side.</p>

<p>‘Drive on to that door marked “Office,”’ he
whispered.</p>

<p>Frost-face appeared in the doorway. Elbert’s
fixed smile of greeting had not yet registered for a
return glance. Frost-face began lifting off his
wide hat. Elbert couldn’t remember ever having
seen before that hard white head, uncovered.</p>

<p>‘She’s some—car,’ Frost-face said suddenly.</p>

<p>‘We were just ridin’ by. Thought I’d—’ Elbert
began, but the foreman wasn’t paying attention.
Finally in the strain Elbert pursued:</p>

<p>‘Any sick cattle?’</p>

<p>‘No, but we’re on the watch. Is she a six?’</p>

<p>‘No, an eight—straight eight. Thought we’d
like to see Cal and Slim—’</p>

<p>‘Up in Wyoming—when I heard last—playin’
the round-ups and the rodeos.’</p>

<p>‘We were just ridin’ by,’ Elbert said.</p>

<p>‘I hear Slim sat Poison-face for twenty-five
seconds at Cheyenne.’</p>

<p>‘Are they coming back?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>‘Ain’t likely. They—you see, we’re using
tourin’ cars mostly to ride range and keep up
fences.’</p>

<p>Now Elbert received his first direct glance. ‘I
see you’re wearin’ everything but your likker
this morning,’ Frost-face remarked.</p>

<p>‘I’m starting East,’ said Elbert.</p>

<p>‘Round by Panama?’</p>

<p>Elbert chuckled. ‘I mean, I’m startin’ East
to-morrow night.’</p>

<p>‘Takin’—the filly?’</p>

<p>‘No, she’s back in San Forenso. You’ll sure
remember me to the boys, won’t you?’</p>

<p>The roadster was rolling quietly out of the
ranch driveway. Mary turned the car south
toward the Border. No word about it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Twilight—Nogales—they were having supper
in a little Yaqui restaurant There were
paper-thin leaves of corn-bread baked in the sun.
He was looking away toward the South.</p>

<p>‘Sometime we must go clear down to the señora’s
house in Nacimiento where we first met,’
he said.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know. We can’t ever find what we’re
looking for by going <i>back</i> to any place. It’s
always ahead.’</p>

<p>‘What we’re looking for,’ he repeated, but not
as a question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>‘It would seem so easy to find; it would seem so
easy to keep,’ she went on, ‘but I don’t know
any one who has kept it. Certainly none of my
girl friends who have married. I don’t even know
what it is exactly.’</p>

<p>‘It’s something that’s kept on building.
Really started when I was in the hospital—no,
before that—at the explosion.’</p>

<p>‘No, before that,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Did it?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, at the barefooted woman’s, where you
were so firm. And then something really happened
to us in that ride back from San Pasquali,
when we were not in our heads.’</p>

<p>‘I had your letter in the hospital.’</p>

<p>‘And then, that day you came to the Finishing
School.’</p>

<p>‘That was a great room to me,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Every day has been different, but it has kept
right on building.’</p>

<p>‘Especially in the mountains.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, wonderfully then—until last week
when I spoiled everything, by getting so nervous
and expectant.’</p>

<p>‘It’s been building all day to-day—with me,’
said Elbert.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she helped, ‘differently from ever before.
And to-morrow night you are starting East—’</p>

<p>‘It will keep right on, won’t it?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>‘It must, but it’s so easy to spoil—that’s
what frightens me. You wouldn’t think it could,
only you see so many others who do—who
have.’</p>

<p>‘It couldn’t be with us.’</p>

<p>‘I think everybody says that at first. You
won’t let me spoil it, will you?’</p>

<p>‘I was going to ask you that.’</p>

<p>‘But you are so firm. You must always be like
that. Why, it’s all because you were so firm that
first night.’</p>

<p>The day was passing fast as a theater scene,
but in the last moments of Nogales, he kept
thinking of the seventy miles back to Tucson.
At least, they had that much left to-day.</p>

<p>‘Won’t you drive back?’ she said at last.</p>

<p>‘Not unless you’re tired?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, I don’t think about it.’</p>

<p>‘Then you—’</p>

<p>Sixty miles still to go. She was driving slightly
under ‘thirty,’ but the minutes were racing by.
She didn’t go any slower. Fifty miles. The roadster
kept its pace, the meter staying around
twenty-eight or twenty-nine, always between
twenty-five and thirty. Forty miles; then half
way. She didn’t cheat.... Stars, sage, warm
wind, early evening.... A thoroughbred, always
different.... What could possibly be spoiled,
if two kept on and on like this? But she knew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>something; and others, he knew, certainly had
spoiled it.... Twenty-five miles.</p>

<p>The night suddenly opened for him. He was
nearer to her than ever before, though he had not
changed position. He could not feel himself or
her, but there was a white ball of light between
his eyes—like all the stars of the gray haze fusing
into one, like all the perfumes of the air fusing
into one, all the stillnesses he had ever known
fusing into one.</p>

<p>‘You—’ from her.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I’m here—’</p>

<p>‘You know something—I must know!’</p>

<p>‘<i>You are something—I must be</i>,’ he went on,
as if finishing a magic formula which she had
begun.</p>

<p>‘Oh, what has happened to us?’ she cried suddenly.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know.’</p>

<p>‘Do you suppose—the others—ever know
anything like that—like this?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ said Elbert.</p>

<p>‘If they did—I don’t see how they could ever
go apart.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Lights of Tucson, streets. The amazement
that he knew now, was that she had kept on
steadily driving.... ‘<i>You are something—I must
be—</i>’ Had she said that, or had he? Had it really
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>been spoken at all? And the car hadn’t halted a
moment.</p>

<p>‘But we must never stop—no matter how
wonderful it is—and say “This is it,”’ she repeated.
‘We must always keep on and on—’</p>

<p>‘It’s so very much—right now—’</p>

<p>‘I know—I know it is—but don’t ever let
me stop and say: “We’ve found it.”’</p>

<p>The car drew up at the curb of the Santa Clara.</p>

<p>‘To-morrow. Luncheon. I’ll come at twelve—right
here.’</p>

<p>Then he stood upon the pavement, differently
alone.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was after 11.30, next morning. Elbert had
sent a telegram to his father that he was starting
East to-night. Passing the desk he saw a paper
in his box.</p>

<p>‘Friends of yours in Suite 14,’ it read. No signature.
Writing he hadn’t seen before.</p>

<p>He stood still for a moment. It wouldn’t be
necessary to go up right now. She would be in
front in fifteen or twenty minutes. He might let
the message wait until afternoon. But after that,
perhaps they would be going out somewhere.
Better now, yet the hush he was in was hard to
break. It was like a spell, yet the elevator door
stood open.</p>

<p>It wasn’t Bart who opened the door of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>upper room but the old don of El Relicario, and
graciously behind him, biding her time, the señora.
Then from an inner room (was the crucifix there,
too, and the white flower?) came the corn-dust
maiden.</p>

<p>‘Ah, Señor, you were so brave—it was all because
you were so brave!’</p>

<p>And behind her sounded the easy flowing laugh—words
from Bart:</p>

<p>‘Everybody here but the rurales!’</p>

<p>‘Only—’ said Elbert, ‘only my friend—a girl—I’ll
get her now—and bring her up.’</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
